This happens with musicians straddling both the worlds of music and acting or directing. Krysten Ritter is one such person as her first job in the entertainment industry is not exactly what she does now. She is famously known as an actress but before she made it to the big screen, she worked as a model.</p><p>Over the years, Ritter has been able to earn her stripes as she has today appeared in numerous notable works. One of her most popular works is her role as superhero Jessica Jones in the 2015 drama series of the same name. The show, which ran for four years, has further fortified her already flourishing career, giving her an enviable edge among her counterparts. It would be interesting to find out how the actress journeyed from the humble beginnings to this maximal point in her life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ritters-early-days-as-a-model></span><strong>Ritter’s Early Days as a Model</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the world of modeling, there are people who scout for those that look like they would be a great fit for a career in the field. In 1996, one of such persons saw Krysten Ritter at her local shopping mall in Wilkes-Barre Township, Pennsylvania. Krysten was just 15 at the time but because of how she looked; tall and really skinny as she put it, she fit the image of a model.</p><p>The young girl managed to balance her new career with schooling as she attended and graduated from Northwest Area High School in 2000. During that time, she had to travel to both New York City and Philadelphia for work and was able to handle it. Krysten, who was signed with the Elite Model Management agency and Wilhelmina Models, had the massive support of her family and it was indeed a great source of motivation for her.</p><p>After concluding her high school education, Krysten Ritter moved to New York permanently in order to focus on her career. This move proved to be very successful as she established an international-modeling career, appearing in various print ads and on television. She was also able to walk the runway overseas, in Milan, Paris, and Tokyo.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-krysten-ritters-acting-career-came-about></span><strong>How Krysten Ritter’s Acting Career Came About</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Krysten Ritter’s transition to acting happened in the line of her work as a model. During an audition for a Dr. Pepper commercial, she was said to have entertained the casting crew so much that they decided to give her bit-part roles in some movies. Her first role was an uncredited one as a model in Someone Like You (2001). She later bagged some other small roles in a number of TV shows and movies.</p><p>By 2005, Krysten had racked up a good number of appearances that gave her more visibility as an actress. As a result of this, she was able to land her first major role as Gia Goodman in Veronica Mars. She featured in 8 episodes of the show between 2005 and 2006. Her next major appearance came in another television show, Gilmore Girls, where she played the role of Lucy and featured in 8 episodes between 2006 and 2007. All of these appearances kept building up Ritter’s skill as an actress as she was waiting to land her career-defining role.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-notable-projects-and-transition-to-directing></span><strong>Her Notable Projects and Transition to Directing</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Krysten Ritter has along the line been able to land roles in notable television shows like&nbsp;Breaking Bad, Gravity, and Gossip Girl. Her longest role as of 2013 was that of Chloe in the ABC sitcom, Don’t Trust the B—- in Apartment 23 (2012-2013). She featured in 26 episodes of the show. Her performance as the show’s lead character earned her a Teen Choice Award nomination. This paved the way for her to appear in another hit television series, Jessica Jones in 2015 where she played the titular character. For her performance on this show, she has received a number of award nominations and has won the Webby Awards Special Achievement: Best Actress award.</p><p>The Marvel TV series also marked Krysten Ritter’s directorial debut as the actress had an opportunity to direct an episode in season 3.</p><p>In regard to her appearances in movies, Krysten has largely played supporting roles in films like Confessions of a Shopaholic, What Happens in Vegas, She’s Out of My League, How to Make Love to a Woman, and El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-is-she-worth></span><strong>How Much Is She Worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Krysten Ritter was just a teenager at a mall when she was recruited to become a model. While her looks gave her a chance, she has worked very hard in order to get to where she is today as she was quite successful as a model and has been able to launch a successful acting career and also try her hand at directing and writing. She wrote a psychological thriller titled Bonfire that was released in 2017.</p><p>The multi-talented lady, who can play the guitar and is said to have a lovely voice, has also tried her hands at music but it is not clear if she has been able to earn anything significant from it. In 2012, Ritter and a childhood friend of hers named William Thomas Burnett formed the indie rock duo Ex Vivian and released a self-titled debut album. All of this has translated into her having an estimated net worth of $7 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-krysten-ritter-dating></span><strong>Who is Krysten Ritter Dating?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Krysten Ritter has been in the spotlight for more than 2 decades and in that time, she has been in a good number of relationships. Since 2014, however, she has been in a relationship with musician Adam Granofsky who goes by the stage name Adam Granduciel and serves as the frontman of the indie rock band, The War on Drugs.</p><p>On the 29th of July, 2019, Ritter and Granofsky welcomed to the world a son named Bruce Julian Knight Granofsky. Before she had her child, she had kept her pregnancy a secret until when she had to go to the Oscars where she revealed her bump. Fans and the entire public were left in awe when information of Krysten’s pregnancy was revealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKOirsC1sc1mqaKspJq%2FtHnTq5inq5mptrC6jJ%2BpqKVdorylscuipaBlpKR6oq%2FToqWgZZGjsW6ywJyrrGWRl7y2wIyhnKtlkqTGp77InqWdZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkrysten-ritters-transition-from-modeling-to-acting-and-facts-about-her-boyfriend.html&text=Krysten%20Ritters%20Transition%20From%20Modeling%20to%20Acting%20and%20Facts%20About%20Her%20Boyfriend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkrysten-ritters-transition-from-modeling-to-acting-and-facts-about-her-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkrysten-ritters-transition-from-modeling-to-acting-and-facts-about-her-boyfriend.html&title=Krysten%20Ritters%20Transition%20From%20Modeling%20to%20Acting%20and%20Facts%20About%20Her%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkrysten-ritters-transition-from-modeling-to-acting-and-facts-about-her-boyfriend.html&title=Krysten%20Ritters%20Transition%20From%20Modeling%20to%20Acting%20and%20Facts%20About%20Her%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkrysten-ritters-transition-from-modeling-to-acting-and-facts-about-her-boyfriend.html&title=Krysten%20Ritters%20Transition%20From%20Modeling%20to%20Acting%20and%20Facts%20About%20Her%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkrysten-ritters-transition-from-modeling-to-acting-and-facts-about-her-boyfriend.html&description=Krysten%20Ritters%20Transition%20From%20Modeling%20to%20Acting%20and%20Facts%20About%20Her%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./may-30-wordle-answer-hints-and-solution-for-wordle-345.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="May 30 Wordle Answer: Hints and Solution for Wordle 345">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kourtney-kardashian-reveals-surprising-family-news-with-travis-barker-two-years-after-wedding.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kourtney Kardashian reveals surprising family news with Travis Barker two years after wedding">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
