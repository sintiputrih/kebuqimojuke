It takes place in the Ruby/Sapphire Battle Tower. Comments welcome as I am not the bgest at writing these yet. I used my Sapphire game as a basis for this story.<p><b><span><span>“Hoenn Battle Challenge 1: Jared vs Joyce”</span></span></b><br><span><span>It was a rainy day in Hoenn as a strong looking trainer got on Captain Sterns ship bound for the Battle Tower. Now this was before the battle frontier was built and there was only a battle tower.</span></span></p><p><span><span>On the ship, the trainer brought out his three Pokémon he hoped to challenge and beat the trainers in the tower with. First his naughty natured Claydol which he caught the first time he went into the Sky Pillar near Pacifidlog town. It knew four moves, Ancient Power, Sandstorm, Hyper Beam and Cosmic Power. It had been a few months since he caught the Claydol and it listened to him most of the time he was training it in the desert area just passed the Winstrate Family home, north of Mauville City.</span></span></p><p><span><span>He then brought out his trusty Bellossom, caught in the Hoenn Safari Zone. It was evolved from a gloom he caught there using a sun stone he had obtained on his travels. It was a serious Pokémon and never would back down from a challenge. This trainer had it for a long time and they were looking strong together. It had won all 4 ranks of the smart contests with its dazzling moves. It knew the moves Poison Powder, Stun Spore, Sleep Power and Petal Dance.</span></span><br><span><span>The final Pokémon he wanted to use to help beat the battle tower was his Exploud whom he caught as a loudred on his way through victory road to challenge the E4. It had an adamant nature and even though it was hard to get along with at times because it had just evolved in the past week, it was a great Pokémon. It knew moves Water Pulse, Stomp, Hyper Beam and Roar. When it roared it was kinda scary.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The trainer had a talk with his Pokémon and got them ready for the challenge ahead. About 30 minutes later he got off the ship and made his way towards the battle tower. A young woman came out; she had long black hair and a white dress on. She was smiling and saying “21 wins! Yay!” Hmm, would it be easy? Not for our trainer.</span></span><br><span><span>The trainer made his way into the building and went up to the counter. A woman standing there with shortish blonde hair asked him his name, where he was from and the pokemon he was going to enter.</span></span></p><p><span><span>“My name is Jared. I am from Littleroot town. I am here to challenge the lower level battle room please.” “And your three pokemon?” said the woman. “Oh yes, a Bellossom, a Claydol and my good old Exploud!” “Ok, could you take a seat until we are ready for you?” Asked the woman. “Sure” said Jared.</span></span></p><p><span><span>A while later the woman, came back and showed Jared to his battle room. Nervous, but feeling confident, he went into the room to await his challengers.</span></span><br><span><span>As he entered a girl came in shouting “Be kind to the digital idol” “My name is Joyce and I accept your challenge!”” She was a feisty looking opponent. She wore a pleated dark green shirt, white shirt and black socks. “Go Xatu!” said the girl. OK, this was Jareds time, “Come on out, bellossom!”</span></span></p><p><span><span>“OK, let’s make this an easy win bellossom, sleep powder!” Bellossom sprayed a power all over Xatu, but it was poison powder! “No bellossom!” too late, Xatu’s synchronise poisoned bellossom! “Xatu, use future sight!” commanded Joyce. Xatu looked deep at bellossom and used future sight. “Lets do this, use Petal Dance, bellossom” so bellossom launced itself towards Xatu. “Dodge Xatu and then use confuse ray!” but Xatu was not fast enough, it hit. But the petal dance did little damage. “Dodge the confuse ray bellossom!” it tried to dodge, but tripped and got hit by the confuse ray. “Oh no!” said Jared in a nervous tone. “Hahahaha” cackled Joyce. Bellossom looked hurt by the poison, as did Xatu. Bellossom went at Xatu again and managed not to hurt itself. It landed another petal dance. Xatu was looking badly hurt now. “Night shade, Xatu, you can still win this” but Xatus attack missed. It fainted as it was hurt by poison. Bellossom won that one. “Way to go bellossom! Now come back and have a good rest.” The fist pokemon was done for.</span></span></p><p><span><span>“Go Shiftry” said Joyce looking happy. “OK, let’s see.... go Exploud!” Exploud came out, but it looked a little slower than shiftry. “Shiftry, you can beat this one easily. Use extrasensory.” Shiftry managed to jump up and used extrasensory, badly hurting Exploud. Thinking to himself Jared thought and told Exploud to use hyper beam. It looked like it only did about half damage to Shiftry. “Shiftry, lets end Exploud by using Ariel ace!” Shiftry jumped up and with its leafy hands, sliced Exploud. Lucky Exploud looked still standing. It looked very hurt, but it looked as if it would not give up its battle.</span></span></p><p><span><span>“Shiftry, you can win, use torment. Exploud has to rest after using hyper beam!” As Exploud stood there, it took the torment and could not use hyper beam a second time. “Solar beam Shiftry!” said Joyce, smiling more now. Shiftry took in the sunlight pouring from the window above. “Hmm, I know it’s a grass type, but it looks almost out, so I could get Exploud to use water pulse, and that could win this.” Thought Jared to himself. “Water Pulse, Exploud you can win!” said Jared sounding confident. It made a large ball of water appear in its mouth and used its hands to plunge the ball of water hard at Shiftry. It could not move due to getting ready to use solarbeam. Alas, it was not good enough, it did not knock out Exploud and Exploud was KO’d by the solarbeam. “Yay! Just one more left and a badly injured bellossom!”Said Joyce happily.</span></span><br><span><span>“Hmm, what can I do now? Go Claydol” said Jared in an awkward tone of voice. “Ancient power that Shiftry, Claydol, you can win this! I have faith in you” said Jared feeling mighty confident. It used the mighty ancient power and KO’d shiftry. Now Joyce had only one Pokémon left. Which one could it be?</span></span></p><p><span><span>“Wow, you might beat me” said Joyce “Go Cacturne!” said Joyce with a smirk. “It won’t be today however!” “Use Poison Sting Cacturne, poison Claydol!” It jumped at Claydol and stung it. It did poison Claydol. “Claydol was moving about awkwardly. “Hyper Beam Cacturne, Claydol, lets finish this once and for all” But no, it missed as Cacturne dodged the attack. “hahaha, use soalar beam Cacturne!” Cacturne took in sunlight and as it was doing so, Claydol hit it with an Ancient power, was not even told to use this by Jared. “Huh Claydol, what are you doing?” said Jared, looking upset. Cacturne used Solar Beam and KO’d Claydol. Jared brought out bellossom, but it was too hurt and fainted because of poison.</span></span><br><span><span>“Yes, we did it” said Joyce as she jumped up and down. “Its tougher than it looks” said Jared disappointed. Maybe we need more training.</span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyxu8qepKimXZeutcDLnmScoJGhuaa6xp5lbGxgbX5w</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpokemon-battle-challenge-34081.html&text=Pokemon%20Battle%20Challenge%20%7c%20Bulbagarden&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpokemon-battle-challenge-34081.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpokemon-battle-challenge-34081.html&title=Pokemon%20Battle%20Challenge%20%7c%20Bulbagarden" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpokemon-battle-challenge-34081.html&title=Pokemon%20Battle%20Challenge%20%7c%20Bulbagarden" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpokemon-battle-challenge-34081.html&title=Pokemon%20Battle%20Challenge%20%7c%20Bulbagarden" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpokemon-battle-challenge-34081.html&description=Pokemon%20Battle%20Challenge%20%7c%20Bulbagarden" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rodney-atkins-wife-rose-falcon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rodney Atkins and wife Rose Falcon Found Love Unexpectedly">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jayden-federline.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Jayden Federline And Sean Federline  Britney Spears Children">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
