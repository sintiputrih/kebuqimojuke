Thomas Hagan, a 22-year-old African-American man was arrested shortly before midnight and charged with murd*r.</p><h2><strong>How Many Times was Malcolm Sh0t?</strong></h2><p><strong>According to the authorities, Seven bullets hit Malcolm.</strong> There were three additional black victims. About two hours later, police claimed the sh00ting appeared to be the consequence of animosity between Malcolm’s supporters and the Black Muslims, an extremist group from whom he had broken.</p><p>Malcolm was found to have died from “several gunsh0t w0unds,” according to the preliminary autopsy results. The office reported that two bullet calibers and sh0tgun pellets were removed from his body.</p><p>Two people may have caused a commotion as a diversion, and a total of five may have been involved in the plot, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to one police theory</a>. Hagan appeared to have fractured his left leg when being kicked, and he was sh0t in the left thigh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/How-Many-Times-was-Malcolm-Sh0t-1.jpg><p>According to the night supervisor, he was being treated in the jail wing of Bellevue Hospital with as many as a dozen police officers assigned to his protection. A cartridge case containing four unfired.45 caliber shells were reportedly discovered by the police in his pocket.</p><p>Assistant Chief Inspector Harry Taylor who was in charge of the uniformed police in Manhattan’s North said that two more African-American men were sh0t as obvious onlookers. William Harris was sh0t in the belly and William Parker was hit in the foot; both individuals were identified.</p><p>They were both transferred to the nearby Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center after the incident. Captain Paul Glaser of the Community Relations Bureau of the Police Department announced that Malcolm X had been k!lled by Hagan with a double-barreled sh0tgun whose barrels and stock had been shortened.</p><p>Captain Glaser reported that as Hagan fired at Malcolm, Malcolm supporter Reuben Francis produced a. 45-caliber automatic weapon and sh0t Hagan in the leg. Bronx resident Francis was arrested and charged with felony assault and a Sullivan Law violation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/How-Many-Times-was-Malcolm-Sh0t-2.jpg><p>Hagan’s real name is Talmadge Hayer, according to the FBI. His name in the system is Thomas Hagan. According to the F.B.I. files, the suspect may be found at 347 Marshall Street, Paterson, New Jersey.</p><p>According to his criminal record, he was detained in Passaic on November 7, 1963, for being in possession of stolen goods.</p><p>At 5 o’clock, not quite two hours after the sh00ting, Sanford Garelick, Assistant Chief Inspector in charge of the police Central Office Bureau and Squads, said, “this is the result, it would seem, of a long-standing feud between the followers of Elijah Muhammad and the people who broke away from him, headed by Malcolm X.”</p><p><strong>To read more about the circumstances surrounding Malcolm X’s dea†h, check out the articles we’ve linked below:</strong></p><p><strong>Note: </strong>We have that much information related to the Malcolm X case.
