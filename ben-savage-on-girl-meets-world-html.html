There’s a comfort in his surrogacy, as he has moved from the one primarily learning lessons to the one teaching them (though he still learns a few). When the news came out that the Disney Channel was making a&nbsp;<i>Boy Meets World</i>&nbsp;sequel<i>&nbsp;</i>called&nbsp;<i>Girl Meets World</i>, young adults born between 1984 and 1991 or so were cautiously super-excited. However, over the course of its first season, any doubts were washed away. Beyond being super-popular with the kids the show was targeting,&nbsp;<i>BMW</i>&nbsp;fans were&nbsp;<a href=#>really impressed by the new show’s execution</a>. With the second season of&nbsp;<i>Girl Meets World</i>&nbsp;premiering tonight, Vulture spoke with Savage about how his character has grown between the two series,&nbsp;<i>Girl Meets World</i>’s surprisingly heady season two, and the meaning of life.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-aac983f3ed82bbc25953d9872c3f97e8-4-0-0@published data-word-count=114><b>What’s it like so many years later to talk to full-grown adults like me who are obsessed with what you did as a kid?</b><br>It’s flattering. It’s exciting. What really means a lot to me is when people come up to me — and it happens a lot — and say, “I grew up on <i>Boy Meets World</i>, and it means so much to me, and I like that I’m now able to watch <i>Girl Meets World</i> with my kid because it’s like passing the torch between generations.” That’s what we set out to do. We were aiming to teach the lessons of <i>Boy Meets World</i> in an updated context to a younger audience.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-aac983f3ed82bbc25953d9872c3f97e8-5-0-0@published data-word-count=83><b>Even when we’ve written about it, people have just appreciated that it was being talked about seriously.<br></b>They’re very protective of the show. That was one of the things that we got a blowback from initially. It was like, “Oh, it’s on Disney Channel, it’s gonna be ruined!” We’re halfway through our second season — if [only] the fans knew how hard the writers work not only to replicate <i>Boy Meets World</i> but also to tell these new stories in a different context. <b></b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-aac983f3ed82bbc25953d9872c3f97e8-6-0-0@published data-word-count=147>I’m so protective of the Boy Meets World legacy. I’m a creature of habit, and superstitious. I even listen to the same music every day that I listened to then (<a href=#>Third Eye Blind, Counting Crows, Tori Amos</a>). So, the two people that I said I wanted back on the show were the original studio teacher who taught <i>Boy Meets World</i>&nbsp;— he taught all seven years of Boy Meets World; he’s now the studio teacher for the girls on the show — and then our script supervisor, Kathy Giangregorio, who was our script supervisor all seven years of <i>Boy Meets World.</i> I was like, “I want to look out and see Kathy, just like we did on <i>Boy Meets World</i>. It’s the most calming presence in the world.” And then it’s all of our old writers, it’s all of our old producers. It’s this incredibly surreal, nostalgic feeling.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-aac983f3ed82bbc25953d9872c3f97e8-7-0-0@published data-word-count=152><b>Was there a moment in season one where it was like, yeah, this works?<br></b>Yeah, it took a while, and I’ll be the first to admit it. There were a lot of high expectations, and there’s no way that the pilot of a brand-new show could live up to the hype of seven seasons plus 15 years [of] buildup. So our first season was a transitional season. Second season, we’re bringing back a lot of old characters from <i>Boy Meets World</i>, and it’s kind of a nod to the <i>Boy Meets World</i> audience, like, “It’s okay to come back and join us.” And we’re tying up a lot of loose ends that people had lingering questions about for years. We just had Mr. Turner on.<b> </b>He was in a car accident his last episode of <i>Boy Meets World</i>, and we never explained what happened.

Is Ben <i>this</i>?” We’ve done now about 35 episodes, so I know more. Cory is a <i>very </i>passionate teacher, but he’s fun and easygoing. He’s a very passionate father and I believe that he really cares about his kids. But then you bring back the old <i>Boy Meets World</i> characters and he immediately reverts to being 17, 18 again.

No one does that!<br></b>Yeah!<b> </b>We just did a show, “Girl Meets Belief,” which wrapped on Tuesday, about the existence of God and what that determines in terms of how you make your decisions in life, and whether that’s important. Cory delivers this whole speech about a prism and how you think nothing’s there, but if you hold up a prism, you can see the colors of the rainbow. It tells us that God is there. It just shows up in different ways. Just because you can’t see it doesn’t mean it’s not there. When you look through that wall, you don’t know what’s behind there, but there are people behind there.

I definitely want to continue directing, I want to continue producing. I really do like working in the vehicle of kids television, because there was a phase of sitcom TV which was just snark. And I hate snark. It doesn’t inspire people. I want to make TV that makes people laugh.<b> </b>Networks were trying to be edgy, and it wasn’t good. It didn’t work. People — networks and everyone — have to just accept themselves for who they are, and then they can be great. <b></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f0e/8f2/ddf27a83899ca7c2aab4f0c78a5269bf68-11-ben-savage-1.rvertical.w330.jpg> <span class=ambrose-short-hed>Ben Savage on <i>Girl Meets World</i></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobmdganyjsc1mqpqukZyybrvNZp6iqpxiuqax06xksKeiobFvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fben-savage-on-girl-meets-world-html.html&text=Ben%20Savage%20on%20Boy%20Meets%20World%2c%20Girl%20Meets%20World%2c%20and%20the%20Meaning%20of%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fben-savage-on-girl-meets-world-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fben-savage-on-girl-meets-world-html.html&title=Ben%20Savage%20on%20Boy%20Meets%20World%2c%20Girl%20Meets%20World%2c%20and%20the%20Meaning%20of%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fben-savage-on-girl-meets-world-html.html&title=Ben%20Savage%20on%20Boy%20Meets%20World%2c%20Girl%20Meets%20World%2c%20and%20the%20Meaning%20of%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fben-savage-on-girl-meets-world-html.html&title=Ben%20Savage%20on%20Boy%20Meets%20World%2c%20Girl%20Meets%20World%2c%20and%20the%20Meaning%20of%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fben-savage-on-girl-meets-world-html.html&description=Ben%20Savage%20on%20Boy%20Meets%20World%2c%20Girl%20Meets%20World%2c%20and%20the%20Meaning%20of%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./greys-anatomy-huge-change-teased-season-19.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Big change for Grey's Anatomy's Meredith Grey teased for season 18">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-criss-cross-applesauce-by-dear-me-andres.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Meaning Behind The Song: Criss Cross Applesauce by Dear Me &amp;amp; Andrs">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
