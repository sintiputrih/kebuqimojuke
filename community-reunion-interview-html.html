Because Britta’s character in particular, it was such a — all props to my colleagues — but it was such a straight-dude version of a girl as a carrot, you know, for the male protagonist. From the way we dressed her to every line of her dialogue, it was like we didn’t discover the Britta character for a long time, and by the end of the series … Britta became so developed. I think of the pilot and I’m just like, Oh, she was a mannequin.<br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Do you agree, Gillian?</strong><br>Gillian Jacobs: She certainly changed.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyu9003x3g6827aw0ka3@published data-word-count=10>Harmon: But you knocked it out of the park also.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyua003y3g68kox3vwow@published data-word-count=4>Jacobs: Oh, thank you.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyua003z3g68xmy2jmg7@published data-word-count=2>Brown: Yeahhh!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyub00403g68l6x271ns@published data-word-count=125>Jacobs: I think about the first Winger speech when I think about the pilot. What was essentially Community to me was Joel delivering the sharks and pencils and Ben Affleck speech. But the thing that was special was that I had never gotten to do a pilot that was that well written. Then when we started shooting it and were sitting around the table, I was just blown away by the extraordinary talent of the people in the cast, which the world has since discovered. But that truly felt like something special. And I remember one of the camera operators said to me, “You better find your apartment in L.A.” No one had ever said that on any pilot I’d been a part of before.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyuc00413g68m7watdbr@published data-word-count=14>Joel McHale: He was a stalker and had nothing to do with the pilot.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy anchored" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck2z1uj9n00fq3g680eu9bsxf@published><span class=anchor-span id=intro-statistics></span> <span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Introduction to Statistics”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyuc00423g68dgnkpn6o@published data-word-count=117><strong>We’re going to go through the series based on your favorite episodes, so the first choice is season one, episode seven, “Introduction to Statistics.” Danny had mentioned this. Danny?</strong><br>Danny Pudi: When I think about the show, I think this is the first time, during this episode, that felt like we were all clicking. I think everyone was kind of doing their own thing and everyone showed up. The costumes were all very specific. It felt like the world was kind of starting to establish itself, meaning that the world was … there was nothing. It was just chaos. And I got to play Batman, which was a dream of mine ever since I was a kid, so.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyud00433g68ovg32nid@published data-word-count=31><strong>Can you still do the voice? Can you do it right now?</strong><br>Pudi: Uh, yeah. Also one of my favorite lines: [In Batman’s voice] “Chex Mix. Pretzels. Baby carrots. Predictable but appetizing!”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyud00443g68joqwswbe@published data-word-count=9>Harmon: This was Justin Lin’s first episode he directed.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyue00453g68nojpgcsw@published data-word-count=7>McHale: He never went on to anything.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyue00463g68fnsnpahr@published data-word-count=116>Harmon: He rigged the chair-fort explosion. And the other thing is after NBC changed its clock, it just happened that this was the first episode, about six episodes in, where the tags started needing to get shot. So, this episode was the first time that we put Troy and Abed together in this intimate way, in that tag for that episode, where you guys are sitting there improvising really about Cookie Monster and stuff. And so this episode was the birth of that friendship, which was based on organic chemistry between actors on set as opposed to us having predetermined that Pierce and Troy were going to be, like, the Beavis and Butt-Head of the show.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyuf00473g68cq9xht2e@published data-word-count=206><strong>In many ways, rewatching it, it felt like a sort of second pilot, where it’s like a complete reintroduction. What did you learn from this episode that paved the way for the show to become the show that we think of when we think about Community?</strong><br>Harmon: I think that because it was about six or seven weeks after the pilot. The weird thing back then was that if you had a show on NBC and you opened your laptop, you could, for the first time — Twitter was relatively new, [and] I was just watching people watch the show. This episode was being produced around the time I was watching people watch the pilot. And I was watching what they were responding to. What they were responding to was obviously character. They were quoting lines, and the lines weren’t one-liners. They weren’t like Henny Youngman jokes that were really crafted. They were lines that encapsulated the characters, that made them unique. So I think that was the big thing for me — as of this episode, there was a puberty that the show kind of hits, because it was just like, Oh, these characters are real. You service them and then the world can be insane.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyug00483g68b2gt0u4k@published data-word-count=7>McHale: Apologies to the Henny Youngman fans.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyuh00493g681pgyhgff@published data-word-count=11>Harmon: These millennials.

He was like, “Yvette, it’s a comedy.” “You don’t understand, I’m the only black woman on this show.” So I went to Dan and I talked to Dan and I said, “Listen.

What was that about that scene that was so special to you?</strong><br>Harmon: It was the perfect scene. You showed a clip of it when we came out. “I don’t like being excluded Jeff, do you? Yes!” And it’s just such a great example of it. I’ve never been a joke writer, and I didn’t write those lines about that and those aren’t jokes, but those are lines that are incredibly funny because you love the characters. There are jokes coming from those other characters, and it was just this high point of Chevy. I was like Finally! As much as he hates doing TV — and he should because it’s hard and he’s a self-described legend. Legend. Legend, legend, legend. I have a tic. I say “self-described” just randomly. A very self-described carpet, I love it. No, but like, I get it. I get it, like, from coming from features and having like this career, working the hours that these guys work, was grueling to him, but I remember [thinking] in that moment, Chevy is finally going to thank me. He’s going to see this episode. He might get an Emmy or something. Like, this is like an amazing character for him to play, and it’s courtesy of our writers, Chris, Andrew Guest, Megan Ganz, and me. I had a milk crate full of my old D&D stuff from when I was a preteen, and I hung on to that stuff because Marie Kondo didn’t exist yet and it did spark joy. It did. And I brought it into the writers’ room and just plopped it on the table, and the pride I felt when the writers’ room didn’t go … I was like, “If you guys want to take a look at this stuff, you know, I’d love to do a D&D episode.” And they were like “All right.” And then I went to set or I went to the edit bay, and I came back and had this pitch, this idea.

That Daffy Duck kind of version of Pierce who’s being dragged out by the ear by Jeff and lectured. It was just magical. And Joe Russo was on point. He’s the guy that’s going to go on and make Marvel movies, but he’s owning that room. There’s no special effects in that episode. Boy, what a show. Just such a good character piece and then the whole thing, yes. We wrote it till 11 a.m. We stayed up all night at Andrew Guest’s house, did shots of whiskey to wake us up after finishing the script, brought it in in time for the table read, read it, and because Game of Thrones wasn’t out there yet, Sony had to have a special meeting and said, “There’s a lot of goblin in this script.” And one of them said, “We wish you had handed this in on time so we could have thrown it in the garbage.” And I was so proud, because this justifies everything about my horrible dysfunctions.

The show wasn’t like, I don’t know, Family Guy. I’ve seen it. My therapist watches it. The show doesn’t just go “Hey, thanks for tuning in. We’re going to do Taming of the Shrew this week.” I grew up watching Moonlighting and I observed, Oh, I love Moonlighting, but this seems like it’s off the rails. And God bless him for experimenting, but it’s like that was the deal-breaker, that it wasn’t an expression of a character. Abed was the guy that made it possible to riff in the vocabulary that the character understood, thereby making it more realistic than if I just did stories about credit cards and jealousy and dyeing your hair. I just understood, like, how do you relate to people without getting kicked out of society? Abed was a film major, and it allowed for this stuff.

A lot of long hours, but we had a lot of fun on set, and you know, it’s a family, so that would be fun for me to be back and do that.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyxq00ba3g68481hl114@published data-word-count=34>Jeong: You look back, it’s just like we’re all here because it’s, for me personally, I think it’s the best thing I’ve ever done, been a part of.

So that is truly extraordinary, and I’m glad that I had the ability to see that in the moment and appreciate it and not just in retrospect. But for that alone, I think it has to be up there for me, No. 1, and I’m so grateful for it. I think for a lot of us, it changed our careers too as actors, in terms of where our careers had been, and so, I mean, it changed everything about my life. So it has to be No. 1.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyxt00bi3g686na62n50@published data-word-count=203>Pudi: I’m echoing that. Definitely No. 1. From the moment I read the script, like was like trembling, because my agent said, “This is the role you were meant to play,” and they had never said that before or after. So I was like “Okay,” and then I read it, and I was like “This is unbelievable.” The writing is just so rich, it’s so specific. The cast is obviously incredible, and they’re just amazing. So on set, it was just such a joy. Always unpredictable and exciting, and we’d read the script, it was funny. We’d get on set, it became funnier. We’d watch it, and we’d still laugh, and that to me was just so joyful. And then yeah, connecting to people, I get reactions all the time. People saying “You’re just like me and my best friend,” or they’ll quote stuff to me from Farscape that I have no idea what they’re talking about. Or people will be like, “Hey, Parks and Rec,” and I’ll be like, “Wrong show, but thanks.” That’s fine. We’ll take it. But truly, I feel so lucky, so fortunate. To laugh every day like this, it’s the best, so for me, No. 1. No. 1.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyxu00bj3g68jwctws7p@published data-word-count=96>Brie: I think what is unparalleled is the amount of laughs that we had behind the scenes. There will never be another job where I cry, cry laughing every day. Like the silliness level was at an all-time high, and we were so close and still remain close and are such a family. Sometimes Betty Gilpin, who I worked with on GLOW, will be like, “I’ve watched the outtakes from Community, and you don’t do that here.” And I’m like, “I’m being professional now.” This is a new side of my career where I’m an adult.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyxu00bk3g68f9h68zb5@published data-word-count=7>Pudi: You don’t do taco taco taco?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyxu00bl3g68le30wkds@published data-word-count=70>Brie: I don’t do taco taco taco and I don’t do get that goo gone. I also will cherish the amount of languages and voices and characters that we created backstage behind the scenes — when people would come in to play like a guest-star role, I always felt for them because we were very warm and inviting, but we would be quoting jokes that didn’t make it to air.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyxv00bm3g687fckp1ry@published data-word-count=5>Brown: So many inside jokes.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyxv00bn3g68jcvo9o3j@published data-word-count=85>Brie: We had shirts made that said “Don’t Eat the Crab Dip.” But they didn’t say, “Yay Yay-ee.” The version we had was, “Don’t Eat the Crab Dip. What!” Because that’s what we thought was the quote for a full calendar year or however long before we watched the episode, and Troy was like, “Don’t eat the crab dip. Yay yay-ee.” They ran it with that one. That sounds interesting. So, yes, I feel like the fun that was had, it can never be matched.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyxw00bo3g688iynsz7k@published data-word-count=218>Brown: The greatest gift of Community, for me, has been getting to watch all of these people at the beginning of their greatness. You know, like just you, all of you, it’s like they were starting out. When Gillian talks about it changed her life, she was living in New York and this was, she moved to L.A. for this job, you know? Everybody blossomed on this set, and we got to watch each other. Everything that we’re doing now that you guys love, we got to watch the seeds of that in everyone. So I talk about Donald, but it’s true for each one of them. We got to watch each of them be great and become great, and that’s something that I cherish. I don’t know if you guys know this, I’m like a huge celebrator of people, so whenever one of them does anything, if you see my Twitter, I blow it up because I’m so proud of everything you guys do. I ran into Alison at the Golden Globes. I’m like, “I’m seeing Allison at the Golden Globes, and she’s nominated!” It’s just huge for me, just that I got to see these amazing performers at their beginning — some had already made it, but at the beginning is the greatest blessing for me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyxy00bp3g68g7yz5hu6@published data-word-count=50>Rash: I feel bad because mine’s going to be exactly the opposite.

Someone else did all the work. No real quick, it’s so hard when you’re in something like this, or anything in life, to be completely present in it. It’s really when you’re sitting onstage here, reflecting on this thing that you see this, that you see these clips that you realize that’s what it was doing — it was tugging at my heart when I was there, and I really do appreciate every moment we had on there. Long hours, the creativity, the fact that we were living in a bubble where we were fighting as these underdogs creatively. I mean not creatively underdogs, but I’m just saying we could do things, experiment, and people were like, “What are you doing?” And then a handful, a giant handful of people got us, and I think that there’s such a reward in knowing that we’re telling stories that challenge some people. You’re breaking molds, you’re doing something that’s not on TV, you’re doing epic things, you’re doing small things, you’re doing character things, and you never lose sight of your characters, and Dan’s exactly right. We were saying lines that were connected to character, and I thought that was such a gift. And, so I would say, in conclusion, to this, as I said, let me just briefly, say, so let me end by saying, “Jim, shut the fuck up.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyy300c33g68m0lzgesc@published data-word-count=20><strong>Anything to add, Dan or Joel?</strong><br>McHale: I’ll keep it brief: It’s the greatest fucking thing that’s ever happened to me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyy300c43g68p802hi93@published data-word-count=8>Rash: For me, what was so powerful …</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyy400c53g68ek6807o7@published data-word-count=27>McHale: Anyway, I wanted to say this one thing.

No, this is absolutely the thing that I will always be the most proud of. I mean, network TV isn’t necessarily dead, but it’s turned into a different thing. It’s all becoming streaming platforms now. We were there with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, and like we were there at the end of this crazy era. The end of must-see TV, the end of broadcast.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyy600c83g68gdr8epdv@published data-word-count=5>Jacobs: We helped kill it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyy700c93g68nm6fghdt@published data-word-count=9>Harmon: We were the tar pit of that period.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyy700ca3g68yc1jx8ue@published data-word-count=5>McHale: We were the barn.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2z1fyy700cb3g683k8bycee@published data-word-count=31>Harmon: And we got to work with, there was 150 people that were A-list.
