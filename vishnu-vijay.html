At present, the TV actor is portraying the lead role of Prabhu in the TV series Sathya on the network channel Zee Tamil.</p><p>Likewise, he made his impact as an actor by playing the role of Vishnuvardhan in the TV series, Office. This series also co-stars famous actors like Karthik and Shruthi Raj. The TV actor then made his debut as a film actor with the film&nbsp;Mapla Singam.&nbsp;It is a 2016 film in which he plays a supporting role.

Similarly, he also won the “Favourite Comedian Fiction” award at the 2014 Vijay Television Awards for his role in&nbsp; Office.
