The Australian-born Londoner plays a fame-chasing character who has decided to deploy the formula of Fleabag and stages a monologue called Wildfowl about a sex-crazed, over-the-top “relatable” woman who works a quirky job at a wetlands trust and hits rock bottom. One Woman Show has, in fact, made Kingsman successful: It got noticed at a London festival, was acclaimed in the West End, then toured in Australia, and has now arrived in New York, where (with a few edits) it will run at the Greenwich House Theater through August 11.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljesa2yy001q3b6xwz875s8t@published data-word-count=89><strong>Jackson McHenry: Your character in the show really wants to be famous, and now she’s made it to New York. Does actual fame change the show?</strong><br>Liz Kingsman: In a way, the play only really made sense in the first room it was performed in, which was this festival in a damp place under the railway station. But I think I can still buy that this woman is never going to be satisfied, so I can always find a way for her to be unhappy about the place she’s in.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljesa9tc001w3b6xfjs4p14s@published data-word-count=78><strong>Did you see a lot of one-woman shows as research?</strong><br>The research phase is a very comfortable, procrastination-heavy place, so I stayed there as long as possible. I had a wall of Post-it notes. If there was something that I had seen in three different one-woman shows, it would get a Post-it note. Every time I did the show, I’d add in one more thing from the wall. I still have five or six that never made it in.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljesa9tc001y3b6xjs2d50zm@published data-word-count=42><strong>What’s on those?</strong><br>I was gonna get them published, but I decided not to, at the 11th hour. Much to the chagrin of the publishers, I got in my head about hating it in six months’ time and being like, Why would I publish that?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljesa9tc00203b6x3aps3uxv@published data-word-count=117><strong>Why give the show-within-a-show character a job at a wetlands trust?</strong><br>I wrote an initial draft of this while I was working in Cork, Ireland, in a hotel room that had a view out over a weir, watching birds in a river all day. It was just literally in front of my eyes. Then when the show got reviewed in The Guardian, the actual Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust sent an email that was, like, endowed with confusion. I had to explain to them that I never thought anyone was going to see this. For the West End, I paid them back, because we put them in the program and had a way to donate on the way out.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljesa9td00223b6xtd3dxe2h@published data-word-count=99><strong>How did you develop this deeply craven woman desperate to get the attention of TV producers?</strong><br>My friend Lola and I sat down and basically pretended that she was you, interviewing me for a publication after the show had come out. She asked me questions and I answered them and then I spent time transcribing hours of this improv into a sort of script. Then we did another session where we were both elite women interviewing each other about their eliteness, like it was a panel or something. We put an excerpt from that in the program as additional content.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljesa9td00243b6x90bn0gg8@published data-word-count=104><strong>In this show, the character’s boss is an Australian woman who points out that Liz is acting like a stereotypical manic pixie dream girl for attention, basically becoming a voice of reason in the middle of this parody. What were her origins?</strong><br>I couldn’t figure out how to get my own thoughts in there versus the character of Liz’s. I had the idea that there could be someone in the story who just says them, which sounds so simple now. I said that to my director, Adam Brace, and he said, “Oh, that’s fun,” and if he said, “That’s fun,” you knew it was correct.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljesa9te00263b6x0d9dqcjv@published data-word-count=64><strong>At this point, can you still appreciate shows of the kind you’re poking fun at?</strong><br>That hasn’t changed. It has affected my relationship to auditions—I can’t audition for any roles that are too similar to the one that I parodied. Imagine if I just, at face value, played a woman hitting rock bottom? But those roles are quite fun! I’ve made things harder for myself.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljesa9te00283b6xciakk9hf@published data-word-count=113><strong>You spend the show in black overalls over a striped shirt, a deeply “relatable girl” outfit. [Ed. note: Phoebe Waller-Bridge wears a </strong><a href=#><strong>very similar outfit</strong></a><strong> in Fleabag.]</strong><br>People think it’s a reference to one particular TV show, but it’s not. They all wear overalls in these shows. You think there would be a crazy reason, but it’s just that black and white are the only colors you can wear when you’re doing an hour-and-ten-minute show without sweating through. It’s the safest, classiest thing that’s in the realm of these tropes. If you go downstairs into my greenroom, it’s just a sea of striped shirts and black overalls. I have no system, so they’re everywhere.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljesa9te002a3b6xtzboi5pe@published data-word-count=18><strong>All the same, or are there variations?</strong><br>They’re four of ASOS’s best designs.
