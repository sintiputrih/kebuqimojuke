They share three children together.</p><p>Their shifting to Spain worked out to be instrumental in Achraf’s professional career after he joined the esteemed youth system of Real Madrid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Achraf-Hakimi-Parents.png><p>Achraf Hakimi parents were in Madrid when he was born, even though the African couple came from Moroccan roots.&nbsp;</p><p>On November 4, 1998, Achraf Hakimi’s parents brought their newborn son to the Spanish metropolis of Madrid.&nbsp;</p><p>His early years as a football player began when he joined the Colonia Ofigevi team in Getafe, Spain, at the age of seven.</p><p>At the age of eight, he moved from Colonia Ofigevi to Madrid to play for the Real Madrid academy team.</p><p>Achraf Hakimi parents left no stone unturned in raising their children.</p><p>In 2022, Achraf Hakimi mother, Sadia Mouth, became a topic of conversation when she became popular for the photo where she kissed her son after Morocco beat Spain in the round of 16.</p><p>However, his mother went viral a few days before when it was revealed that Hakimi’s all property, income, and salary were under his mother’s name. This <a href=#>news</a> shocks his wife, Hiba Abouk, who recently filed for divorce and demanded half of the Moroccan footballer’s property.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Achraf Hakimi wife filed for divorce after he went under investigation for rape</h2><p>Young Achraf Hakimi started dating Hiba Abouk in 2018 when he was 19, and she was 31. The couple shares two children.</p><p>Subsequently, the Paris Saint-Germain star defender was accused of raping a woman he had invited to his marital home. According to the victim, this event took place when his wife and family were in Dubai.</p><p>The origin of the events is on January 16, when Achraf Hakimi and the young woman began to speak on the Instagram social network.</p><p>On Saturday, February 25, the young woman would have gone to the player’s home in Boulogne in an Uber that the PSG footballer himself would have requested, who invited her to his home while his wife and children were on vacation in Dubai.</p><p>According to the victim, upon arriving at the soccer player’s house, Hakimi kissed her on the mouth, then lifted her clothes and kissed her b*easts despite the fact that she refused.</p><p>The girl also assured that the player came to penetrate her. At that moment, the young woman herself kicked herself free. Released, she sent an SMS to a friend who came looking for her.</p><p>The girl, terrified, went to the police office, alleging that Achraf Hakimi had r*ped her. Although she did not want to file a complaint at first, the Police, given the seriousness of the events, decided to act ex officio and open an investigation.</p><p>Later, an investigation was opened into the matter last month in February into the allegations made against the Morocco international.</p><p>Hiba recently communicated as the procedures were already underway, her divorce after the French prosecutor accused the PSG star of rape.</p><p>However, Hakimi has declined the allegation, stating that he is the target of ‘racketeering.’</p><p>At the same time, Hiba spoke out in favor of the victims in the cases of rape in which her former spouse was trained.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Achraf Hakimi’s divorce leaves his wife empty-handed due to clever asset management</h2><p>Footballer Achraf Hakimi, who was accused of rape by a young woman on February 25, 2023, is in the process of divorce from his Spanish actress wife, Hiba Abouk.&nbsp;</p><p>The Paris Saint-Germain defender has left his wife, Hiba Abouk, empty-handed and without any alimony following her divorce petition.</p><p>The PSG defender receives more than ten million euros a year from his club, so his ex-wife asked for 50% of his property and thus thought she had hit the jackpot, but when she took the steps in court, she realized that the Moroccan footballer had no assets.</p><p>The former Real Madrid player had registered all his property and assets under his mother’s name since the start of his career.</p><p>For now, the football player has not yet made a statement to confirm or deny these facts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Achraf Hakimi Parents are the proudest ones on the planet: He puts 80% of his salary under their name</h2><p>Hakimi is one of the high-paying footballers in Ligue 1 . Receiving a large sum every month, the football star coached by Christophe Galtier, who is also accused of being racist, made the decision to put everything in the name of his mother.</p><p>80% of his salary is deposited monthly in Achraf Hakimi parents account. In that sense, the international has no properties, cars, or jewelry to his name. When he wants to make a purchase, he asks his mom to do it for him.</p><p>When the actress sued her 24-year-old husband, she expected to receive an equal share of his $70 million upon separation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The vital ingredients behind his journey to the top</h2><p>Achraf Hakimi, is a footballer of Moroccan origin. He spent his childhood in Getafe. Hakimi grew up in a very modest family.&nbsp;</p><p>Achraf Hakimi father is a street vendor, and his mother is a cleaner at building sites.

In 2015–2016, he played UEFA Youth League matches and reached the semi-finals.</p><p>A year later, he played with second-division club Real Madrid Castilla.</p><p>His good performances lead Zinédine Zidane to ask him several times to participate in the internships and training sessions of the Real first division team.&nbsp;</p><p>Hakimi took part in the 2018 World Cup with the Morocco team. That same year, he left to play in Germany following a loan to Borussia Dortmund. In 2019, then aged 21, the young footballer was named one of the 50 best young players in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2020, he joined the Italian professional team Inter Milan with which he played for a year before joining Paris Saint-Germain. In 2022, he participated in the World Cup in Qatar with the Morocco team and played a match against the France team and his friend Kylian Mbappé.&nbsp;</p><p>On July 6, 2021, he signed a contract with Paris Saint-Germain for a sum of 60 million euros with 11 million in bonuses.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Achraf Hakimi’s net worth?</h2><p>Achraf Hakimi net worth is reported to be around $24 million.
