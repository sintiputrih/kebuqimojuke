In some cases, those fans have been rooting for Swift and Kelce to find happiness together. Conversely, some people have openly ranted about how sick of the duo they are.</p><p>One person who speaks about Swift's and Travis Kelce's relationship differently is Jason Kelce. Thanks to being within the couple's inner circle, Jason Kelce has been able to comment on how much pressure Swift and Travis Kelce are under from a different perspective.</p><p>In June 2024, Jason Kelce appeared on "the Whiskey Ginger podcast with Andrew Santino". During the resulting conversation, Jason Kelce commented on how wild it is to see the level of pressure that Swift and Travis Kelce are under. When E!

What did Jason Kelce say during the podcast interview? As an E! News article about the podcast interview reveals, Jason Kelce spoke about <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how out of control Swift and Travis Kelce's fame is</a></strong>.</p><p>"It's been crazy. Travis and Taylor have taken it to another level and that's a whole other side of it.

As Jason Kelce explained, he believed that <strong>Travis Kelce had handled being Swift's boyfriend with style</strong>.</p><p>During a June 11th press conference, Travis Kelce was asked about the kind of food he and Taylor Swift cook together. In response, Travis Kelce put on a master's class on how to handle an overly personal question with grace. "I respect that question, but I'm gonna keep that one to myself. Because I thoroughly enjoy cooking with her, so it's something I'd rather keep personal."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jason-kelce-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More specifically, Jason Kelce explained that despite all the pressure Travis Kelce is under, he believed that <strong>his brother hadn't let it change him</strong>.</p><p><strong>"I think he's stayed true to himself. </strong>He's humble. He treats everyone with the utmost respect, like they're equals, regardless of who they are."</p><p>On top of praising his brother, <strong>Jason Kelce also lavished praise on Taylor Swift for how she handles fame</strong>.</p><p>"The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she's just living, enjoying life."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/here-are-the-craziest-things-taylor-swift-fans-have-done-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After seeming extremely sincere when he spoke about how well Swift handles her fans, Jason Kelce still wasn't through.

During that podcast episode, Jason Kelce explained <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the kind of fan who has typically approached him in the past</a></strong>.</p><p>"Before, it was mostly fat, hairy guys who'd recognize me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jason Kelce then went on to talk about how that has changed since Travis Kelce began dating Taylor Swift.

After all, Jason Kelce made it clear that the <strong>young people who approach him aren't excited to meet a famous football player</strong>.</p><p>"Now, it's 12 to 14-year-old girls saying, 'Oh my God!
