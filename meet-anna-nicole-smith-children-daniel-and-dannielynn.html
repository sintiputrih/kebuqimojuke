Anna Nicole Smith remained in the spotlight thereafter by appearing in several celebrity publications. She adored being in the headlines and receiving so much media attention. The year 1995 saw the release of the film “To the Limit,” in which she played a significant part. In the film, she played a retired spy seeking vengeance against her husband’s killer.

Smith was raised by her mother and aunt following her parents’ divorce in 1969.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;She had five half-siblings&nbsp;on her father’s side.&nbsp;Smith&nbsp;was primarily raised by her mother and her aunt. They are Donnie Hogan, Donna Hogan, Amy Hogan, David Tacker and Donald Hart.</p><p>Celebrity Net Worth reports that Smith’s net worth was estimated at&nbsp;$1 million&nbsp;at the time of her death in 2007.</p><p>In 1994, Smith married an 89-year-old billionaire named J. Howard Marshall II claimed that he wanted her to have half of his estate when he passed, despite not putting her in his will.</p><p>Anna Nicole Smith gained a great deal of attention by marrying the 89-year-old oil magnate, J. Howard Marshall II, at the age of 26. She was desperately attempting to establish a cinematic career. She was constantly handed roles to capitalize on her sexual icon status.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meet Anna Nicole Smith Children, Daniel and Dannielynn</h2><p>Smith gave birth to son Daniel from her marriage to Billy, and daughter Dannielynn from a relationship with photographer Larry Birkhead. She and her children shared a strong bond and were inseparable until her untimely death in 2007.</p><p>Smith had a difficult year in 2007 because she gave birth to her daughter while also losing her son to a ‘drug overdose.’ But she demanded the ‘truth’ of her son’s mysterious passing be told by hiring another pathologist.
