In 2012, she starred in one of the most famous reality TV Show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. Most of her fans consider her to be a pioneer of the current reality TV series. However, she and her husband, Geno Doak, experienced many problems in life, which ended up breaking apart their marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Mama June ‘Rewarded’ With New Show After Admitting Spending $1 Million On Drugs</a></span></p><p>Fans noted that the duo had a stormy relationship that invited trouble wherever they went. Their drug addiction led to several arrests, as well as losing sources of income. From issues related to drug abuse to even death threats from Geno Doak, here is what happened to the couple.</p><h2 id=mama-june-39-s-addiction><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Mama June's Addiction</span></h2><p>In an exclusive interview with ET, June opened about<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> her struggle with substance abuse</a>, which caused her to lose material gain and herself along the way. Her methamphetamine addiction almost ruined everything she had fought so hard for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star became dependent on drugs so much so that she got high whenever she felt like it. Sadly, her ex-husband was an addict too, and with time, to service the drugs they consumed in a day required up to $2,500 a day. Since they were not making enough money to acquire the drugs, the couple ended up selling their house.</p><h2 id=mama-june-and-geno-doak-39-s-arrests><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mama June And Geno Doak's Arrests</span></h2><p>Mama June and her husband Geno Doak were once again in trouble after police officers arrested them in March 2019 on drug paraphernalia charges and possession of a controlled substance. The police arrested the duo in Alabama, and after the arrests, the authority had to take away their youngest daughter and find some legal custody for her elsewhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was difficult for both the family, as the separation brought more crisis on top of a felony charge, as well as a misdemeanor charge at the time.</p><h2 id=mama-june-39-s-sentence><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mama June's Sentence</span></h2><p>At a gas station, Mama June and her longtime boyfriend engaged in a domestic dispute that led to their arrest. The mother of four was at the height of her addiction, which had taken a hit on her health and income.</p><p>Though they were both charged, the worst of all is that the court subjected her to 100 hours of community work and took kids away from her. Additionally, she became subject to conditions like random drug screenings and court supervision.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> 'Mama June: From Hot To Not': What Is Sugar Bear's Job?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=geno-doak-threatened-to-kill-mama-june><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Geno Doak Threatened To Kill Mama June</span></h2><p>Many people were left discombobulated by the fact that the lovers were arrested due to a fight that escalated while they were at a gas station. What the majority don't know is that during that period Doak had verbally attacked June to an extent of threatening her with her life.</p><p>The dispute got heated very fast went out of control when June told Doak that if he killed her, he wouldn't get any more TV money.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Mama June Fans Wonder Where She Got $75,000 For Plastic Surgery Amid Drug Battle</a></span></p><h2 id=geno-doak-39-s-sentencing><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Geno Doak's Sentencing</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the arrest and hearing of the case in Alabama, Geno Doak's drug case led him into a 16-months sentence in Macon Community Corrections after copping a plea deal. Lucky for him, he was not incarcerated, though he registered as an inmate.</p><p>After the dismissal of his drug paraphernalia charge, Doak's part of the plea also involved two years probation, where he was to finish a substance abuse treatment and evaluation.</p><h2 id=geno-doak-jeopardized-mama-june-39-s-relationship-with-her-daughters><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Geno Doak Jeopardized Mama June's Relationship With Her Daughters</span></h2><p>In the journey to sobriety, Mama June went to rehab over substance abuse, and just two days after rehabilitation, she risked going to jail when they were arrested in Alabama.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For her, it was absurd that Doak had wanted to tell the daughters about their recent arrest, which could see them jailed.

According to the 46-year-old businessman, he felt like he was in a dark spot in life, and as a way to end his suffering, he attempted suicide by ingesting 90 blood pressure pills.</p><p>''It was my first actual attempt where it was a conscious decision saying, Ok, I don't want to be here anymore," Doak said. When asked what he wanted, Geno Doak said that he wanted to go to a mental facility, and June suggested The Oaks in South Carolina.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=geno-doak-refused-to-be-sober-and-that-ended-the-relationship><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Geno Doak Refused To Be Sober, And That Ended The Relationship</span></h2><p>Reports indicate that the end of this toxic relationship was inevitable, because as June continued with her healing journey back to sobriety, Doak, on the other side, refused to walk on the same journey with her. Fortunately, June celebrated every month that she finished sober and even revealed that she was over that lifestyle.</p><p>However, since Doak couldn't handle it, the two split up.
