"So I’d suppress it, and the more I suppressed it, the bigger it became.”</p><p>Gisele also explained in the interview that she considered jumping off a balcony, which led to her surrounding herself with loved ones and trying to have healthier habits. <strong>This tough period of her life helped her realize the Inception actor was not right or her, despite her love for him</strong>. “Was I alone in wanting to do some serious soul-searching while he stayed the same?
