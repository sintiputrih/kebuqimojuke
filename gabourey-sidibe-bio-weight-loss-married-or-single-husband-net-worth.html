She started writing her memoir in 2015 and was able to raise $2,500,000 for it.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Gabourey Sidibe&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Married or Single?&nbsp;Husband</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sidibe has never been married and is currently single.&nbsp;To our knowledge, she is not dating anyone and has never had a relationship with anyone in the entertainment industry or outside.&nbsp;However, she openly talked about what her ideal man would look like.</span></p><p><span>“I’m 5’4, so if you’re 5’6, I’ll consider you tall because you’re taller than me,” Sidibe said in an interview with People.&nbsp;“If you’re 5’7/8, please also apply: I’ll ride you.”</span></p><h2><strong><span>Weight loss and measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>Gabourey Sidibe is a perfectly confident young woman with a lot of self-esteem.&nbsp;This is despite the fact that she is an overweight black woman who works in a racist and image-conscious entertainment industry.&nbsp;She managed to be a great role model for plus size women by feeling good about herself and sharing her experiences growing up with a family that tormented her for her weight.</span></p><p><span>Her life changed, however, when, in 2016, she discovered that she and her brother had diabetes.&nbsp;Following the diagnosis, she made a decision that would change her life.&nbsp;She underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery in an effort to manage her weight.</span></p><p><span>From time to time, Gabby posts photos on Instagram of herself, showing the progress she has made.&nbsp;She currently weighs 122 kg and is 5 feet 4 inches tall.&nbsp;His body measures 44-46-46 inches.&nbsp;Her bra size is 38 inches.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGifkZe8tr7EsmSsoZSer6Z5waKmZq%2BVnrSpwIylpqyrXaKus77Inptmp6JiwKq6xqWcZqClqK%2BiusNmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgabourey-sidibe-bio-weight-loss-married-or-single-husband-net-worth.html&text=Gabourey%20Sidibe%20Bio%2c%20Weight%20Loss%2c%20Married%20or%20Single%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgabourey-sidibe-bio-weight-loss-married-or-single-husband-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgabourey-sidibe-bio-weight-loss-married-or-single-husband-net-worth.html&title=Gabourey%20Sidibe%20Bio%2c%20Weight%20Loss%2c%20Married%20or%20Single%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgabourey-sidibe-bio-weight-loss-married-or-single-husband-net-worth.html&title=Gabourey%20Sidibe%20Bio%2c%20Weight%20Loss%2c%20Married%20or%20Single%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgabourey-sidibe-bio-weight-loss-married-or-single-husband-net-worth.html&title=Gabourey%20Sidibe%20Bio%2c%20Weight%20Loss%2c%20Married%20or%20Single%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgabourey-sidibe-bio-weight-loss-married-or-single-husband-net-worth.html&description=Gabourey%20Sidibe%20Bio%2c%20Weight%20Loss%2c%20Married%20or%20Single%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jacory-harris.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jacory Harris">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./brie-larson-channels-the-nutcracker-by-twerking-in-a-tutu-tchaikovsky-presumably-rolls-in-his-grave.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brie Larson channels The Nutcracker by twerking in a tutu, Tchaikovsky presumably rolls in his">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
