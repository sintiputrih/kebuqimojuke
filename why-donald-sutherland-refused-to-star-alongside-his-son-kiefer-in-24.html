In September 2006, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox announced</a> that the role would be played by actor James Oliver Cromwell&nbsp;(Easy Street, Six Feet Under).</p><h2 id=flaws-in-the-character>Flaws In The Character</h2><p>Before all this,&nbsp;Kiefer had asked his father Donald Sutherland to join him in the cast of 24 and play the said bad guy in Season 6. Sutherland senior&nbsp;however refused to portray Phillip, because of&nbsp;certain flaws that he found in the character.</p><p>Phillip Bauer first appeared in the series shortly into the sixth season. At that point, he was&nbsp;trying to cover up the fact that he had been involved in a plot to help terrorists acquire Russian-made nuclear suitcase&nbsp;bombs.&nbsp;The terrorists intended to deploy these on US soil.</p><p>At first, he managed to convince his son Jack - working for the federal agency, Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU) - that he was only doing it to protect the family business and Jack's brother Graem from indicted on&nbsp;treason charges.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joss Whedon Had This To Say About Donald Sutherland</a></span></p><p>It eventually turned out that the conspiracy ran much deeper than that, and that Phillip's motivation&nbsp;had only been the preservation of his own legacy. In the course of&nbsp;his self-serving quest, he ended up killing Graem, threatened to kill his grandson, Josh, and came very close to killing Jack himself.</p><p>This type of character was not in the least appealing to Donald Sutherland. In an old engagement with a reporter, he said, "I told Kiefer, 'I'd love to play Sean Connery to your Harrison Ford (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Indiana Jones</a> and the Last Crusade), but not a father who wants to kill you.' We're looking for something else we can do together."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Donald-Sutherland-with-son-Kiefer.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-humanizing-traits>No Humanizing Traits</h2><p>Cromwell was himself critical of the writing of his character, as he did not see any humanizing traits that would have made him connect with&nbsp;Phillip Bauer and his motives better.</p><p>"I had never seen the show before, and I took it because my agent said it was important to do, that it would be a good thing. They paid me a lot of money to do it," he said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview</a> after he had exited the show. "And then I’ve taken my son captive and I’m torturing him, then I was going to take my grandson captive and threaten him. So I went to the producers and I said, “Look, are there any redeeming qualities to this character?” They looked at me as though I was nuts, I was asking something bizarre."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Actors Who Hated The Television Roles That Made Them Famous</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Donald made the comment&nbsp;about his desire&nbsp;to work on a project with his son&nbsp;in 2008.&nbsp; Nearly seven years later, the Sutherland father-and-son duo finally got to live their dream. They came together to&nbsp;create&nbsp;the Western film,&nbsp;Forsaken, where they indeed played a father and his estranged son.</p><p>Kiefer was&nbsp;elated at the outcome&nbsp;and shortly before the movie release, he was quoted saying, "I’ve wanted to work with my father for 30 years, and I’m really grateful that I finally had the opportunity. And it ended up—the experience and, I believe, the film—better than I could ever have hoped for."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">9 Sweetest Celebrity Mother-Daughter Relationships</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbyvrcudZKytpJ2ys7jAp5tmqpWbwrSxw2arqGWjqa6zecClpqefo56xpnnHoqpmq5%2Bjeqy1xJ%2Bcq2WZo3pzgI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-donald-sutherland-refused-to-star-alongside-his-son-kiefer-in-24.html&text=Why%20Donald%20Sutherland%20Refused%20To%20Star%20Alongside%20His%20Son%20Kiefer%20In%20%2724%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-donald-sutherland-refused-to-star-alongside-his-son-kiefer-in-24.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-donald-sutherland-refused-to-star-alongside-his-son-kiefer-in-24.html&title=Why%20Donald%20Sutherland%20Refused%20To%20Star%20Alongside%20His%20Son%20Kiefer%20In%20%2724%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-donald-sutherland-refused-to-star-alongside-his-son-kiefer-in-24.html&title=Why%20Donald%20Sutherland%20Refused%20To%20Star%20Alongside%20His%20Son%20Kiefer%20In%20%2724%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-donald-sutherland-refused-to-star-alongside-his-son-kiefer-in-24.html&title=Why%20Donald%20Sutherland%20Refused%20To%20Star%20Alongside%20His%20Son%20Kiefer%20In%20%2724%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-donald-sutherland-refused-to-star-alongside-his-son-kiefer-in-24.html&description=Why%20Donald%20Sutherland%20Refused%20To%20Star%20Alongside%20His%20Son%20Kiefer%20In%20%2724%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./john-beasley-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Beasley Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tim-wakefield-age.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tim Wakefield Age: How Old Is Tim Wakefield?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
