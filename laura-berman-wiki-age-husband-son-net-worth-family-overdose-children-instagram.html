Samuel Berman Chapman died Sunday in his bedroom of what his parents believe to be cocaine and Percocet laced with fentanyl.</p><p>She confirmed to USA TODAY on Monday, February 8, 2021, that her teen son Samuel died on Sunday from an accidental overdose of fentanyl-laced Xanax at their family home in Santa Monica, California. Samuel was 16 at the time of his death.</p><p>Our son Sammy was a beautiful soul who left us way too soon,” she said in a statement provided by her husband, Samuel Chapman. “Our hearts are broken for ourselves and for all the other children that are suffering during this pandemic.”</p><p>She first shared the news of her son’s death on Instagram Sunday, writing that her son got “the drugs delivered to the house” in an “experimentation gone bad.” “My beautiful boy is gone. 16 years old,” the host of “In the Bedroom with Dr. Laura Berman” captioned a picture of herself embracing her smiling son. “My heart is completely shattered and I am not sure how to keep breathing.”</p><p>She said her son got his hands on the unknowingly fatal drug through Snapchat and warned other parents to “watch your kids and WATCH SNAPCHAT especially.”</p><p>“A drug dealer connected with him on Snapchat and gave him fentinyl (sic) laced Xanax and he overdosed in his room,” Berman wrote. “They do this because it hooks people even more and is good for business but (it) causes overdose and the kids don’t know what they are taking.”</p><p>“We call on Snapchat and Twitter to help the Santa Monica Police with their investigation, which according to the police is something the big technology companies regularly refuse to do,” she wrote. “And we encourage every parent to manage their children’s social media as closely as possible.”</p><p>On Monday, Snapchat told USA TODAY that their platform has “zero tolerance for using Snapchat to buy or sell illegal drugs” or other “illegal activities,” as noted in its Community Guidelines.</p><p>“Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of Samuel Berman Chapman and we are heartbroken by his passing,” the company said in a statement. “We have no higher priority than keeping Snapchat a safe environment and we will continue to invest in protecting our community.”</p><p>Snapchat added that it’s “committed to working together with law enforcement in this case and in all instances where Snapchat is used for illegal purposes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=laura-berman-instagram></span> Laura Berman Instagram<br><span
