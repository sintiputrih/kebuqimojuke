Sorvino is a Christian. She resides with her family in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>She starred in Attack on Leningrad (2009), Multiple Sarcasms (2010) with Timothy Hutton and <a href=#>Stockard Channing</a>, and Nancy Savoca's Union Square (2012), with Patti Lupone and <a href=#>Tammy Blanchard</a>. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to good reviews. In the same year, Sorvino played the mother of the lead in the film adaptation of Wendy Mass's popular children's book Jeremy Fink and the Meaning of Life.</p><p>In February 2008, she guest-starred in the "Frozen" episode of the medical television drama House. Making her character, psychiatrist Cate Milton, a recurring character, was mentioned, but the writers' strike put a freeze on such discussions.</p><p>Sorvino met actor <a href=#>Christopher Backus</a> at a friend's charades party in August 2003. On June 11, 2004, they married in a private civil ceremony at the Santa Barbara, California, courthouse, then later had a hilltop ceremony in Capri, Italy. The couple has four children: daughters Mattea Angel (born 2004) and Lucia (born 2012) and sons Johnny <a href=#>Christopher King</a> (born 2006) and Holden <a href=#>Paul Terry</a> Backus (born 2009).</p><p>She has been affiliated with Amnesty International since 2004, and in 2006, was honored with Amnesty International's Artist of Conscience Award given to those who have displayed longstanding philanthropic and humanist efforts.

Her portrayal of a happy-go-lucky prostitute made her a star, winning her an Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress. While the film garnered Sorvino international notoriety, she described the shooting of the film as extremely stressful: "I was absolutely neurotic doing Mighty Aphrodite," she recalled. "Every night brought a new nervous breakdown. I'd cry and talk to God, I was so nervous. Then the next day, I'd show up and do my scenes."</p><p>Sorvino's first major screen appearance was in the teen television series Swans Crossing, on which she appeared in six episodes. When the 1993 film Amongst Friends entered preproduction, she was hired as third assistant director, then was promoted to casting director, then to assistant producer, and was finally offered a lead role. Positive reviews led to other acting opportunities.</p><p>Sorvino was raised in Tenafly, New Jersey, where she wrote and acted in backyard plays with her childhood friend <a href=#>Hope Davis</a> and in theater productions at Dwight-Englewood School. Sorvino has said that as a child she was strongly influenced by her mother to pursue social causes; her mother had participated at the March on Washington. Sorvino excelled in high school, and was accepted into Harvard University. She studied for one year as an exchange student with CIEE in Beijing, China, where she became fluent in Mandarin Chinese.
