In 1971, he attended LeTourneau College in Longview, Texas, and was expelled from the school for keeping a female classmate out past curfew. In 1974, he graduated from Montreat-Anderson College, now Montreat College, with an A.S. and in 1978 from Appalachian State University with a B.A.</p><p>In 1974, at age 22, after a period of rebellion and traveling the world, Franklin committed his life to Jesus Christ while alone in a hotel room in Jerusalem. He was ordained in 1982 by the Grace Community Church in Tempe, Arizona.</p><p>When Franklin was in his early twenties, Dr. Bob Pierce, founder of Samaritan’s Purse, invited Franklin to join him on a six-week mission to Asia. It was during that time that Franklin felt a calling to work with hurting people in areas of the world affected by war, famine, disease, poverty and natural disaster.</p><p>Franklin was elected to the Board of Samaritan’s Purse in 1978, and one year later, following the death of Dr. Pierce, he was elected president of the organization. Today, he serves as president and CEO of the international relief and evangelism organization headquartered in Boone, N.C. Samaritan’s Purse works in the Name of Jesus Christ to provide relief and assistance in more than 100 countries. It has affiliate offices in Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, plus partners and field offices around the world.</p><p>Franklin conducted his first evangelistic event in 1989 and now conducts Franklin Graham Festivals around the world for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA). He has proclaimed the Gospel message at 183 evangelistic festivals in 37 states and 48 countries since 1989.</p><p>In 2016, Franklin launched the Decision America Tour and traveled to all 50 state capitals to hold prayer rallies. The focus of these rallies was to challenge Christians to pray for the United States and its leaders and to live and promote Biblical principles at home, in public, and at the ballot box. The Decision America Tour is continuing this year with multi-city stops in Tennessee and Texas. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association appointed Franklin Graham CEO in 2000 and president of the organization in 2001.</p><p>As a speaker and author, Franklin regularly addresses current moral and social issues, calling Christians to stand for Biblical values and challenging them to make a difference in the world for the sake of the Gospel. He also offers Biblical context and application to current national and world events. Through the organizations, he leads he has been instrumental in helping people impacted by crises including the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the civil war in Sudan and natural disasters ranging from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to earthquakes in Japan, Haiti, and China.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=franklin-graham-age></span><span>Franklin Graham Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was born on July 14, 1952.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=franklin-graham-family></span><span>Franklin Graham Family</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Graham was born in Asheville, North Carolina to Billy Graham and Ruth Bell Franklin, Graham is the fourth of the five children.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=franklin-graham-wife></span><span>Franklin Graham Wife</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He married Jane Austin Cunningham of Smithfield, North Carolina, in 1974.
