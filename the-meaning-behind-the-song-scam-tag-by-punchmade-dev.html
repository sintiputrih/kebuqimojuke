This song is from his album titled “Richest Puncher” which is set to be released on March 17, 2023. Produced by Idle & ProdByThrax, the song is a rap that delves into themes of drug culture, deception, and the pursuit of wealth.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at the meaning behind the song by analyzing the lyrics:</p><p>[Verse]<br>In the first verse, Punchmade Dev talks about his involvement in the drug trade, specifically referencing sending packs of drugs to Mexico. He mentions his addiction to drugs, particularly pills, and how he is trying to quit but finds it difficult. Despite this, he reveals that he continues to press fentanyl pills covertly. This showcases the duality of his character – on one hand, he tries to distance himself from the drugs, while on the other hand, he cannot completely let go.</p><p>Punchmade Dev also touches on the competitive nature of the drug industry, mentioning that he wants to “up the score” and find a supplier for real Percocet pills. He reveals his frustration with someone who stood him up after exchanging addresses, highlighting the potential dangers and risks he faces in his line of work.</p><p>The artist then switches gears to talk about his wealth and success. He boasts about his ability to skip lines at luxury stores like Sak’s and his ability to make money quickly. He flexes his spending power, mentioning how he dropped $60,000 on Cuban jewelry, only to make it back in a week. Punchmade Dev’s lyrics convey the notion of living a lavish lifestyle and the desire for material possessions.</p><p>However, there are consequences to his actions. He mentions a dispute with someone named Punchmade, who took away his firearm. Punchmade Dev acknowledges that his partner may only be using designer items temporarily to take pictures before returning them. This displays the superficiality and transitory nature of their relationship, as well as their involvement in a criminal lifestyle.</p><p>The artist ends the verse by hinting at potential scrutiny from the authorities. He believes that the feds may be monitoring his bank account, placing a “scam tag” on it. He downplays $100,000, suggesting that he has had much more cash at his disposal. Punchmade Dev also mentions someone falling victim to a scam by thinking they received genuine drugs but getting fake ones instead. This serves as a cautionary tale for those involved in illegal activities, emphasizing the consequences and betrayal that can occur within their circles.</p><p>[Outro]<br>The song concludes with a dismissive remark directed at an unnamed person, calling them a “ham” and emphasizing that they will never retrieve what they lost. This further illustrates the ruthless and cutthroat nature of the lifestyle portrayed in the song.</p><p>Personally, I find “Scam Tag” to be a gritty and captivating glimpse into a world that may be unfamiliar to many. The lyrics depict the harshest realities of the drug trade and the pursuit of wealth, highlighting the dangers and moral compromises that come with it. While I cannot relate to the experiences and choices described in the song, it serves as a reminder of the diverse range of perspectives and stories that music can bring to light.</p><p>In conclusion, “Scam Tag” by Punchmade Dev offers a raw and unfiltered look into the artist’s mindset and experiences. The lyrics convey the highs and lows of his involvement in the drug trade, his desire for wealth, and the consequences that come with it. The song’s powerful storytelling and intense delivery make it a standout track that leaves a lasting impact on the listener.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jrBqaKyYmnquscCnoKefXZeyqbXNnWStoJViwLC6xmaqnJmdYsGis4ybsGaopaOwqbnAnZxmnJWrfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-scam-tag-by-punchmade-dev.html&text=The%20Meaning%20Behind%20The%20Song%3a%20Scam%20Tag%20by%20Punchmade%20Dev&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-scam-tag-by-punchmade-dev.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-scam-tag-by-punchmade-dev.html&title=The%20Meaning%20Behind%20The%20Song%3a%20Scam%20Tag%20by%20Punchmade%20Dev" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-scam-tag-by-punchmade-dev.html&title=The%20Meaning%20Behind%20The%20Song%3a%20Scam%20Tag%20by%20Punchmade%20Dev" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-scam-tag-by-punchmade-dev.html&title=The%20Meaning%20Behind%20The%20Song%3a%20Scam%20Tag%20by%20Punchmade%20Dev" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-scam-tag-by-punchmade-dev.html&description=The%20Meaning%20Behind%20The%20Song%3a%20Scam%20Tag%20by%20Punchmade%20Dev" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./188507-gail-kim-busts-breast-implant-ziggler-beth-phoenix-pics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gail Kim Busts Breast Implant?, Ziggler, Beth Phoenix Pics">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./robert-de-niro-gets-real-about-raising-6-biracial-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robert De Niro Gets Real About Raising 6 Biracial Children">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
