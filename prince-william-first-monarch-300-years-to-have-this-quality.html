When he launched Earthshot he was the Duke of Cambridge, but he called himself Prince William. And that's because he's keen to be known as Prince William, because the Americans know and love him as Prince William, they love him above all other public figures, according to a recent poll."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ba88737f6d6f-prince-william-charles-coronation.jpg><p id=eiy5Sk2f-H data-wc=35>Roya was quick to explain the differences between William as a monarch compared to his predecessor: "He'll be a very radical monarch.
