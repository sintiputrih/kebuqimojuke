He is also known as the founder of Metal God Records. He has been an active member on the music scene since 1969.<br>Have you ever wondered how rich Rob Halford is, as of early 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Rob’s net worth is over $25 million. The main source of this amount of money is coming from his successful career as a musician.</p><h3>Rob Halford Net Worth $25 Million</h3><p>Rob Halford spent his childhood in Walsall, a town near Birmingham in England. Before he joined the heavy metal band Judas Priest, he was the singer in several bands such as Abraxas, Athens Wood, Thark and Hiroshima.<br>In 1974, he joined Judas Priest, when his sister introduced him to the founding member Ian Hill – she was Ian`s girlfriend at the time. The two almost immediately hit it off, and Rob became the singer of the Judas Priest. During his first stint with the band, they released 14 albums, some of which achieved gold and platinum status, which increased Rob`s net worth by a large margin. Their first album came out in 1974, entitled “Rocka Rolla”, however, it failed to chart, as well as their second album “Sad Wings Of Destiny”, released in 1976.</p><p>However, their destiny changed the next year, when they switched record labels from Gull to Columbia Records. Their third album, “Sin After Sin” came out in 1977, which achieved gold status, and reached No. 23 on the UK charts. Since then, the band’s career has gone only upwards, and so has Rob`s, as well as his net worth. Their releases became more and more popular, and albums such as “British Steel” (1980), “Screaming for Vengeance” (1982), “Defenders of the Faith” (1984), and “Turbo” (1986) all achieved platinum status in the US, which certainly increased Rob`s net worth by a large margin. After the album “Painkiller” (1990), was released, Rob decided to leave the band, and start a few project of his own.</p><p>Firstly, he started the band Fight, with which he has released four albums, including “War of Words Demos” (1993), “Mutations” (1994), and “A Small Deadly Space” (1995). After that, he created the band 2wo, releasing only one album. In 2000, he started his third band – Halford – through which he has released six albums, including “Crucible” (2002), “Resurrection” (2000), and “Halfor IV: Made Of Metal” (2014), among others, all of which have increased his net worth.<br>He returned to the Judas Priest in 2003, and since then, they have released four albums, “Angel Of Retribution” (2005), “Nostradamus” (2008), and their latest release “Redeemer Of Souls” (2014, which have only added to Rob`s net worth.</p><p>When it comes to speak about his personal life, Rob Halford announced in 1998 that he is openly gay. According to sources, currently he is single and his residence is in Phoenix, Arizona. He is also known for his drug and alcohol addictions. Rob is also a big fan of vintage cars, as he owns in his collection an Aston Martin from the 1970s and a Mercury Cougar.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=13.03664921466><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Rob Halford</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$25 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 25, 1951</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Walsall, Staffordshire, England, UK</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6' 0½" (1.84 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Soundtrack, Actor, Composer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Sue Hill</td></tr><tr readability=0.36><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/robhalfordlegacy</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0355158</a></td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Music Groups</td><td>Breakin' the Law, You've Got Another Thing Comin', Painkiller, Judas Priest, Halford, Fight, 2wo, Hear 'n Aid</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Movies</td><td>Spun, Halford: Live at Rock in Rio III, Pansy Division: Life In A Gay Rock Band, Judas Priest: Live Vengeance '82, Fight: The War of Words: The Film</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=2><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Rides a Harley Davidson motorcycle on stage</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Sunglasses</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Goatee</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Shaved head</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>High vocal range</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Leather</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>7</td><td>Tattoos on the back of his head</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=27.025309336333><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=1.7674418604651><td>1</td><td><a href=#>Queen</a> were an incredible heavy metal band.</td></tr><tr readability=4.1984732824427><td>2</td><td>[on shaving his head] I was going bald, I didn't want to go out looking like that guy from <a href=#>Marillion</a>, or <a href=#>Phil Collins</a> - fuck that.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>3</td><td>[on his trademarked moniker of Metal God] I don't want anybody else to be the metal god but me.</td></tr><tr readability=2.561797752809><td>4</td><td>I feel a bit like <a href=#>Quentin Crisp</a> these days, I've become the stately homo of heavy metal.</td></tr><tr readability=7.7266514806378><td>5</td><td>Freddie (<a href=#>Freddie Mercury</a>) is my ultimate hero.
