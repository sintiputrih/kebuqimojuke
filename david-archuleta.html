I prefer to think that happiness is always there and that when things don’t go the way we might like them to, it’s a sign from above that something even better is right around the corner.”&nbsp;<strong>– David Archuleta</strong></p><p>“It’s so important for girls to respect themselves and not put themselves down and say, ‘Oh, my life is horrible,’ and ‘I’m not pretty enough.’ How do you know? There is this energy people give off that people can be drawn to.”&nbsp;<strong>– David Archuleta</strong></p><p>“Once you let yourself believe that you’ve gotten to the top, you’ve lost sight of the real goal, which is to keep climbing no matter what. And by climbing, I don’t mean trying to outdo yourself with even more accomplishments. Instead, what I mean is that when we think we have done something well, we should start looking at the other areas of our lives that need attention.”&nbsp;<strong>– David Archuleta&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“So as I think back on it now, I think it is safe to say that music is something you both hear and feel. I also realize that feelings change frequently and that, for the most part, they are not a constant. They change from high to low, happy to sad, content to ecstatic, and back down again. Not all music has the same purpose, but most music makes you feel “something.”&nbsp;<strong>– David Archuleta</strong></p><p>“The best thing you can do to set yourself apart is just yourself. If you’re fake, you know people find out who you are later, it’s like, ‘Well, that’s not who we thought you were.’ Being yourself is where you feel most comfortable, and people get, you know, they feel that connection the best.”&nbsp;<strong>– David Archuleta</strong></p><h2>3 Life Lessons from David Archuleta</h2><p>Let’s look at some of the things we can learn from David Archuleta now that you are familiar with his achievements and net worth:</p><h3>1.
