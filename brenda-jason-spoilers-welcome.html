Given I know their history that they “can’t stand” eachother and they are frenemies. They have been married for convience a couple of times together but no love. I would not mind TPTB exploring a “real” relationship with them. I know Jason is annoyed by Brenda and they have NEVER been “friends” like he in Carly. Jason just has always had this feeling to protect Brenda as do ALL the men in her life Jax & Sonny included. She is mesmerizing but Jason has NEVER fallen under her love spell. I wonder how the TPTB would play this out. I know it would be a great storyline and a lot of possibilities. I wonder what Sonny would make of this? It would be unexpected for everyone because not even most fans could fathom this. But I have always been a fan of Brenda and Jason and have always wondered “What if”. What if they grew to be more than frenemies? What if they fell in love? How would this change the canvas of GH? What would this mean for Sonny and Brenda & Jason? I would love for this to be explored. I do understand that Brenda unlike Carly and Sam is the only woman who hasn’t “been with” sexually Sonny, Jason, and Jax so I could see how this could be a turn-off for the developing relationship that Brenda and Jason could have. I want to see it happen though cause I never even thought it was something TPTB would do, but ALWAYS WISHED AND HOPED FOR IT!!!</p><p>HI there;<br>I actually like this idea. It would be different and it would allow Jason to be different. His dialogue with Brenda in the past has always been funny and it would give the character of Jason another dimension. I know most want Brenda with Sonny but I think it might be interesting to see him and Jason both kind of into the same woman. I think a shake up is in order…Jason to me is the same old same old. Please no offense to fans of him with other ladies but lately he’s become boring to me.<br>Just my 2 cents… <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png title=:smiley: alt=:smiley: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I know I would be excited about this. I know they had a Brasen kiss in 1994 when they were in high school and made out also but that’s when Jason was Jason Quatermaine. After his accident Brenda was no more than an obligation to him and he couldn’t stand her especially when it came to Sonny. Brenda and Jason used to go head to head over the issues of Robin and Sonny because they both felt the other wasn’t good enough for their respective partners. They have always had a love/hate relationship mostly hate. Brenda used to HATE Jason Morgan back in the day because of Sonny and Jason hated Brenda. Then their relationship evolved into less hate and more of one of “I can’t stand you” but I don’t hate u so much anymore. I believe that if this could turn into something more it would be EPIC and unexpected and something beautiful. And yes it hasn’t really ever seriously been explored and should be! Writers come on now and help us out with this!!! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>i always loved brenda and jason’s interactions and dynamics. Them as a couple would be interesting on a lot of levels. I wonder what robin’s reaction would be to that? and I am pretty sure Sonny’s head would explode from jealousy. Carly would flip her lid too. I am a Sonny and Brenda fan to the core. But i would enjoy a jason/brenda relationship. Dont think the writers will ever do it tho.</p><p>I see I might be the only one - but I cannot abide Brenda and have quit watching the show after 20+ years since she came back on. Obviously she did not bring out the best in anyone as most all left her at the altar!</p><p>Quote <strong>Scarlett08</strong>: I see I might be the only one - but I cannot abide Brenda and have quit watching the show after 20+ years since she came back on. Obviously she did not bring out the best in anyone as most all left her at the altar!</p><p>Well she is an addiction and an obsession for the men on Gh! They either love her or want to protect her and sometimes both. I have always loved Brenda and many of these men on here broke her to the core. Especially Sonny! And Jason took part in it. For years she dealt with so much heartbreak and pain from Sonny and his bff Jason who helped Sonny be a bastard to her all the time. Jax also broke her heart and he is as horrible as Sonny. Brenda deserves love and a relationship that would be loving and caring. I want the Brenda and Jason thing explored because Jason has become less of a cold hearted individual and more open in a sense to many possiblities. He and Brenda could be magic and could make for a great story if the writers play their cards right. The implications of this relationship would be drastic. Sonny would be pissed! Who knows how Robin will react! Jax would be fuming! Carly would be ready for a fight! Brenda’s comeback is going to effect everyone on the canvas and it ain’t going to be funny. IHEARTBRENDA!!!</p><p>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS IDEA…even though im a Huge Brenda/Sonny Fan…it could be something thats happens after sonny and brenda breakup again and jason has to pick up the pieces as usual but this time they actually connect and take to the next level … <strong>IT WOULD BE EPIC since they’ve know eachother since jason was a quartermaine in highschool</strong>…i wonder if jason realizes that?</p><p>Quote <strong>lulu_morgan</strong>: I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS IDEA...even though im a Huge Brenda/Sonny Fan...it could be something thats happens after sonny and brenda breakup again and jason has to pick up the pieces as usual but this time they actually connect and take to the next level .... <strong>IT WOULD BE EPIC since they've know eachother since jason was a quartermaine in highschool</strong>...i wonder if jason realizes that?</p><p>Yes, I love your thinking Lulu!!! I don’t think he still remembers Brenda as when he was Jason Quatermaine. When he was Jason Morgan he started to detest Brenda and thought she wasn’t good enough for Sonny. Down the line he started to tolerate her and has always felt an OBLIGATION to protect her because of Sonny. Wouldn’t it be nice that he wanted to protect her because he cared about her or even loved her. I would love the words down the line to be I protected you then because there was something more that drew me to you than just Sonny and I protect you now because I know deep down inside their has always been someting there for you. Residual feelings from my life before this. I love you Brenda! Ohh that would be epic! I am sorry for all the JASAM fans but I have been wishing and hoping for this for a long time. I used to be a JASAM fan but if you could give me Brenda and Jason I would completely switch sides. I love Brenda and Sonny but there is to much damage they would do to eachother. It isn’t “safe” for them mentally to be together. They will make eachother unstable. I think Jason could balance Brenda out. I want him to be able to TRULY open up to her. She already knows everything about the business and I would love for them to develop something meaningful and deep. Team Brasen!</p><p>As a writer this would be a great angle. I remember some clips of EmSon on youtube that showed Jason and Sonny at odds over Em. since she was Jason’s sister. Can you imagine how it would be to have them at odds over a woman they both cared about.<br>I am also interested to see how Jason reacts to this older more mature Brenda who is apparently somewhat selfless and does a great amount of charity work for children. He will not find it so easy to put her in a category and forget about her.<br>Carly’s reaction will be interesting. My bet is that Brenda as a famous charitable figure will irk Carly a great deal…it will make her feel less since she does tend toward self-centered pursuits. We all know what Carly does when she feels less…she attacks to make herself feel better. It should be interesting. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png title=:smiley: alt=:smiley: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Quote <strong>writersblock</strong>: As a writer this would be a great angle.

Carly has always been jealous of Brenda! She can’t get past the fact that Brenda was the love of JAX and Sonny’s life and Jason has always wanted to protect Brenda. When Brenda is around ALL the men gravitate and swoon her way. I hope that VMG stays around for a longtime and signs a longterm contract because there is a great deal of possible stories that could be told with her. You know Brenda & Carly bicker 24/7 but Brenda can take Carly down. Brenda will go all Bi-polar on Carly. Ha ha ha ha. And I know Brenda isn’t going to give Jax the time of the day but it would be so funny to see what Carly will do once she sees their interaction and Jax drooling all over a non-caring Brenda. Ha ha ha. Serves Carly right!!!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvBq5ynnJFit6K%2FzqdkrKifnrmmvtJmrp6kk6S6pnuSaWpqbmk%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrenda-jason-spoilers-welcome.html&text=Brenda%20%26amp%3b%20Jason%20%28Spoilers%20Welcome%29%20-%20General%20Hospital&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrenda-jason-spoilers-welcome.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrenda-jason-spoilers-welcome.html&title=Brenda%20%26amp%3b%20Jason%20%28Spoilers%20Welcome%29%20-%20General%20Hospital" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrenda-jason-spoilers-welcome.html&title=Brenda%20%26amp%3b%20Jason%20%28Spoilers%20Welcome%29%20-%20General%20Hospital" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrenda-jason-spoilers-welcome.html&title=Brenda%20%26amp%3b%20Jason%20%28Spoilers%20Welcome%29%20-%20General%20Hospital" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrenda-jason-spoilers-welcome.html&description=Brenda%20%26amp%3b%20Jason%20%28Spoilers%20Welcome%29%20-%20General%20Hospital" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./steve-irwin-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Did Steve Irwin Die?
