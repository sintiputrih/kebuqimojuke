However, reaching the highest level of the sport can often be testing, with massive sacrifices having to be made from an early age.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That includes giving up free time over the weekend to train, and in some cases moving to new areas in order to showcase your skills to leading trainers. For the most part, being a jockey can be a hugely lucrative profession, but how much do horse riders in the sport get paid?</span></p><h2><b>Jockey Earnings</b></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>On average, a jockey in the United States can earn up to $68,000 on average, with one of the highest averages in the profession coming in California. Research has </span><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>found that jockeys located in the San Jose area</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> can earn up to $137,000 on average, which is a staggering 97% increase when compared to other jockeys in the United States.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Experience Counts</b></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, one of the key factors that contribute to the wages that jockeys stand to pick up annually is their experience level at the top level. While $68,000 is the average wage annually, in some cases, jockeys can earn up to $109,000 per year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Experience and success on track are the two key factors that will determine how much a jockey stands to make per year, with those achieving major victories in Grade 1 company being paid more to take rides on the best horses.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Research also found that the lowest average wage earned by a jockey is $14,000 in the United States, with this likely being the wage given to apprentices looking to make their way in the sport.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This is much more than what the average bettor can get on a </span><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>superfecta betting</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> combo.</span></p><h2><b>Significant Races To Win</b></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>There are major Grade 1s run throughout the United States on track, with the </span><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>Triple Crown contests</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> typically being among the most lucrative for jockeys. That is evident by the fact that the winning jockey in the Kentucky Derby stands to take home 10% of the winning purse.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Therefore, in the 2022 running of the race, Sonny Leon was rewarded for his stunning ride on outsider Rich Strike by picking up $186,000. However, it’s unlikely that he would keep the entirety of that sum, as he will likely need to pay up to 30% to his agent, and also hand a 5% tip to the groom that helped him prepare for the race.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But, it’s likely that Leon was still able to pocket a significant amount, and it will likely rank among his biggest payday in the sport.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Independent Workers</b></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>One of the key factors to consider when it comes to assessing the wages that jockeys earn is the fact that the vast majority are freelancers. Therefore, they work independently and aren’t attached to a single yard, and are free to negotiate their wage should a trainer or owner want them on board their horse.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Many of the world’s leading jockeys opt to remain independent so they are free to make money for their skill set, with the average contractor jockey working for between $25 and $300 per ride.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This could be extremely lucrative for jockeys in this position, especially if they have a full book of rides across an eight-race card. However, some of the leading jockeys are also paid handsomely to represent only one stable, with jockeys such as Ryan Moore, William Buick, and Irad Ortiz typically riding for the same trainer should they have one runner in a race.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Highest Earning Jockeys</b></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Racing at the top level of the sport can be extremely lucrative for jockeys, especially if they are able to spread their dominance over a number of years. The leading jockey in terms of earnings in U.S. history is John Velazquez, who has picked up a staggering $477 million throughout his career on track.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Puerto Rican-born rider has an impressive win rate of 18%, with his biggest purses being picked up riding horses such as Authentic, English Channel, and Wise Dan to Grade 1 victories.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Javier Castellano is the second-highest earning jockey in history, having amassed over $396 million in winnings throughout his career. The jockey has won many of the most prestigious races on the U.S. calendar, with his biggest wins in Grade 1 company coming aboard City of Light in the Pegasus World Cup and Ghostzapper in the Breeders’ Cup Classic.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mike Smith has been a stable jockey for Bob Baffert throughout his career, and that has helped him amass prize money of over $348 million. The 58-year-old has rode some of the most dominant modern greats in the sport, with his top-performing stars including Breeders’ Cup Classic star Zenyatta, Pegasus World Cup winner Arrogate, and Triple Crown hero Justify.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydpp6rXZZ6qbvRrJxmqpGYtq%2BzjKOmnKOVrnqmrdGnZKKmXZZ6rrvNrZ9o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-does-a-horse-racing-jockey-earn-in-a-month.html&text=How%20Much%20Does%20A%20Horse%20Racing%20Jockey%20Earn%20In%20A%20Month%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-does-a-horse-racing-jockey-earn-in-a-month.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-does-a-horse-racing-jockey-earn-in-a-month.html&title=How%20Much%20Does%20A%20Horse%20Racing%20Jockey%20Earn%20In%20A%20Month%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-much-does-a-horse-racing-jockey-earn-in-a-month.html&title=How%20Much%20Does%20A%20Horse%20Racing%20Jockey%20Earn%20In%20A%20Month%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-does-a-horse-racing-jockey-earn-in-a-month.html&title=How%20Much%20Does%20A%20Horse%20Racing%20Jockey%20Earn%20In%20A%20Month%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-does-a-horse-racing-jockey-earn-in-a-month.html&description=How%20Much%20Does%20A%20Horse%20Racing%20Jockey%20Earn%20In%20A%20Month%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jamie-yuccas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jamie Yuccas | Wiki/Bio, Labaran CBS, Net Worth, Hotuna, Aski, Miji da Tsawo">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./does-aldi-allow-nose-piercings.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Aldi allow nose piercings?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
