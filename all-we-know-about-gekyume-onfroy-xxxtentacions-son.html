Gekyume was born shortly after his father was killed on 18 June 2018.

Wiki Bio<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy, better known by his stage name XXXTentacion, was born on 23 January 1998, in Plantation, Florida USA – his zodiac sign was Aquarius and he held American nationality. He was a rapper, singer and a songwriter, but also known for his problems with the authorities. Jahseh was raised in Pompano Beach in Florida, mostly by his grandmother Collette Jones. His father is Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy, and his mother is Cleopatra Eretha Dreena Bernard – Jahseh had two paternal half-siblings. At the age of six, a man attacked his mother, and Jahseh tried to stab the man, leading to him being put into a youth program.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B9KGqQIInO1/</p><p>It was Jahseh’s aunt who convinced him to join the school and church choirs, however, he attacked another student and was expelled. His interest in music was born though, and he began writing rap songs around this time. He didn’t matriculate from high school until years later, and later stated how he was depressed most of the time while studying. His career was launched in June 2013, when he released his debut song “News/Flock”. In 2014, he was arrested and jailed for gun possession, and in jail met Stokeley Clevon Goulborne who is a rapper, and the two started freestyling together.</p><p>Upon being released from prison the two met again, planning to rob houses together, however, Jahseh bought a microphone and started making music, and Stokeley followed his example and chose Ski Mask the Slump God for his stage name. Jahseh released his “Vice City” song in the first half of 2014, and then joined Stokeley’s band Very Rare before they both quit and established another band called Members Only. Jahseh’s first extended play (EP) entitled “The Fall” was released on 21 November 2014, and he then went on to release “Members Only Vol. 1” and “Members Only Vol. 2” collaborative mixtapes in 2015.</p><p>His second EP entitled “Willy Wonka Was a Child Murderer” was released on 28 April 2016, but then in that summer he was arrested for robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, and once again in October for ‘false imprisonment, witness tampering, and aggravated battery of his pregnant girlfriend’, according to Wikipedia. Jahseh was released from jail on 18 April 2017, and soon uploaded three new songs onto his SoundCloud account. His debut solo mixtape entitled “Revenge” was released on 16 May 2017, and consisted of eight songs which were reprints from his previous Eps, while his “Member Only Vol. 3” collaborative mixtape was released on 26 June 2017.</p><p>His debut album entitled “17” came out on 25 August 2017, and peaked at #2 on the US Billboard 200. His next EP entitled “A Ghetto Christmas Carol” was released on 11 December 2017, and at the same time Jahseh announced his three new albums which were supposed to be entitled “Skins”, “Bad Vibes Forever”, and “?”. The “?” album – his second – was then released on 16 March 2018, containing 18 tracks and reaching #1 on the Billboard 200. Three days after he was murdered, Trippie Redd, Quavo, and Ski Mask the Slump God (Stokeley) released the “Ghost Busters” posthumous song, while the rapper Ugly God released the song “Tear Drop” the next day.</p><p>It was announced that Jahseh had recorded enough songs for two more albums to be released – his first posthumous album entitled “Skins” was released on 8 November 2018, and Jahseh was also featured on the “Members Only Vol. 4” album released on 23 January 2019. His fourth and last album entitled “Bad Vibes Forever” was released on 6 December 2019.</p><p>Several months before his death, Jahseh announced he was preparing to attend a community college, to study for his bachelor’s degree.</p><p>Jahseh is one of the most controversial American rappers as he was arrested many times, and there were often problems at his concerts with people fighting and trying to kill him. In June 2017 while performing in San Diego, he was kicked in the head and left unconscious while an audience member was stabbed. He was an abusive person, as his ex-girlfriend Geneva Ayala accused him of holding her head underwater in their bathroom, beating and choking her as well as threatening to cut out her tongue and cut her hair.</p><p>Jahseh’s private funeral was organized on 28 June 2019, and some of his close friends who are rappers as well attended, such as Lil Uzi Vert and Lil Yachty. He was buried in a mausoleum at Gardens of Boca Raton Memorial Park.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmcoXq4sYykpaivXZavsMHTZp6eo6mquqZ5zqedq6epYsW5xNOepa2Zk568r7%2BMrKanZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fall-we-know-about-gekyume-onfroy-xxxtentacions-son.html&text=All%20we%20know%20about%20Gekyume%20Onfroy%20%20XXXTentacions%20son&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-we-know-about-gekyume-onfroy-xxxtentacions-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-we-know-about-gekyume-onfroy-xxxtentacions-son.html&title=All%20we%20know%20about%20Gekyume%20Onfroy%20%20XXXTentacions%20son" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fall-we-know-about-gekyume-onfroy-xxxtentacions-son.html&title=All%20we%20know%20about%20Gekyume%20Onfroy%20%20XXXTentacions%20son" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fall-we-know-about-gekyume-onfroy-xxxtentacions-son.html&title=All%20we%20know%20about%20Gekyume%20Onfroy%20%20XXXTentacions%20son" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-we-know-about-gekyume-onfroy-xxxtentacions-son.html&description=All%20we%20know%20about%20Gekyume%20Onfroy%20%20XXXTentacions%20son" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./guillermo-martinez-ayala.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Guillermo Martnez Ayala Stats, Goals, Records, Assists, Cups and more">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-was-the-1st-movie-released-on-dvd.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What was the 1st movie released on dvd">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
