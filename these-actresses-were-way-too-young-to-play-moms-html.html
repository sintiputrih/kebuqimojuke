This isn’t the first time an actress has seemed way too young to sire her screen kin (in one classic case, Anne Bancroft was only eight years older than her The Graduate screen-daughter Katharine Ross), and it’s not even the most egregious example in Tammy, where McCarthy also cast the 11-years-older Allison Janney as her mother. This sort of thing happens all the time to actresses — once they reach a certain age, it’s like they’re filed away in a folder simply marked “old” — and it’s a problem their male counterparts rarely have to contend with. To prove it, we’ve rounded up some recent examples of age-inappropriate casting, then imagined what would happen if some of these believability-busting pairings got a gender flip.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-651a312533cb17c1c9a0ce6cfc847cb3-3-0-0@published data-word-count=19><strong>Tammy</strong><br>grandmother: Susan Sarandon (b.

Even if you throw a white wig on her for a movie like Tammy, she’s still going to seem more like Melissa McCarthy’s mother than her grandma. (It only compounds the believability issues when Allison Janney somehow represents the generation between the two women.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-651a312533cb17c1c9a0ce6cfc847cb3-5-0-0@published data-word-count=32>Male Equivalent: If the 34-year-old Jason Segel starred in a comedy … where his father was played by the 48-year-old Ben Stiller and his grandpa was played by the 57-year-old Tom Hanks.<strong></strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-651a312533cb17c1c9a0ce6cfc847cb3-6-0-0@published data-word-count=14><strong>Forrest Gump</strong><br>mother: Sally Field (b.

Then again, Collette was still in her early 20s when she was cast as the mother of a 9-year-old in The Sixth Sense.

Certainly Michael Bay didn’t seem to when he cast Wahlberg and comedian T.J. Miller as high-school pals in the new Transformers movie, even though Miller is a noticeable ten years younger. But the ballsiest misapproximation of Wahlberg’s age came when David O. Russell approached Melissa Leo to play the actor’s mother in The Fighter, despite the fact that she’s only 11 years older than her screen-son. “I said, ‘Aren’t I too young to play [the] mother?’” recalled Leo, who nevertheless committed to the role. “If the actor believes it themselves,” she <a href=#>told NPR</a>, “they can make you believe it.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-651a312533cb17c1c9a0ce6cfc847cb3-15-0-0@published data-word-count=63>Male Equivalent: If they’d cast a male actor 11 years older than Wahlberg to play his dad, they could have drawn from a pool that includes Kenneth Branagh, Hugh Grant, and David Duchovny, all born in 1960.
