The deportation order entitled “Shugaba Abdurrahman Darman’s Deportation Order 1980”, stated amongst other things that “…Shugaba Abdurrahman Darman at present in Nigeria ought to be classified as a prohibited immigrant” and also that “Shugaba Abdurrahman be deported from Nigeria by the first available means….” Shugaba Darman was promptly deported to a village in Chad. In response to the public outcry against the obviously politically motivated deportation, the government instituted a one man tribunal of inquiry presided over by Justice P.C Okanbo. The NPN government and President Shehu Shagari in particular were quite concerned about the negative press that the issue was generating and also about allusions in the press to the partiality of the tribunal.</p><p>Shugaba Darman’s troubles had allegedly started as a result of him being regarded as a threat by the ruling party of the time, the National Party of Nigeria (NPN). Shugaba Darman was a charismatic politician who attracted large crowds at political rallies, the crowds were drawn to his speeches in which he criticized the ruling NPN government. The government claimed that Shugaba’s father was a Chadian hence he was from Chad. During the subsequent court case filed by the GNPP led legal team of Chief D. O.A Oguntoye, to challenge the deportation order, the government brought a Chadian woman who claimed that Shugaba was her biological son whom she wanted back; this while weeping profusely. Shugaba denied knowing the woman and claimed that his mother was alive and well known in Maiduguri even though her sight was now poor.</p><p>The Maiduguri high court ruled in Shugaba’s favour in the case of “Shugaba Darman vs Federal Minister of Internal Affairs and Others”, revoked the deportation order and awarded damages to the tune of 350,000 Naira to Shugaba. The government appealed the verdict at the appeal court in Kaduna and lost. The case was then taken to the Supreme Court and that court yet again ruled in Shugaba’s favour in a unanimous judgement by the four justices led by Justice Coker. The case was overtaken by the subsequent military coup and no compensation was paid; Shugaba said he had forgiven the Shagari led government for his deportation.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=legacy></span>Legacy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Alhaji Shugaba Darman died on Wednesday April 20, 2010 at the age of 80, he left behind three wives and 29 children. Alhaji Shugaba was a founding member of the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua led Social Democratic Party (SDP), he was also a founding member of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in which he was active as a party elder till he died.</p><p>Perhaps his greatest legacy has been his legal battle with the federal government challenging his deportation; the case has been used as relevant case law in numerous human rights trials in Nigeria ever since. The judgement in itself was ground-breaking and has set a precedent for subsequent cases of human rights violation against the government.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1flq%2BlwdGrmKGlkaN6tLTUoJibmV2ZrrO5wKdkm6GfnL%2BivMeyZJ%2BZk6l6pK3RnpyrZZGsrrOw0malnqxdrLyzwMdmmKecXaG2p7GMrKuoqqlk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fabdurrahman-shugaba-darman-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html&text=Abdurrahman%20Shugaba%20Darmans%20biography%2c%20net%20worth%2c%20fact%2c%20career%2c%20awards%20and%20life%20story&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fabdurrahman-shugaba-darman-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fabdurrahman-shugaba-darman-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html&title=Abdurrahman%20Shugaba%20Darmans%20biography%2c%20net%20worth%2c%20fact%2c%20career%2c%20awards%20and%20life%20story" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fabdurrahman-shugaba-darman-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html&title=Abdurrahman%20Shugaba%20Darmans%20biography%2c%20net%20worth%2c%20fact%2c%20career%2c%20awards%20and%20life%20story" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fabdurrahman-shugaba-darman-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html&title=Abdurrahman%20Shugaba%20Darmans%20biography%2c%20net%20worth%2c%20fact%2c%20career%2c%20awards%20and%20life%20story" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fabdurrahman-shugaba-darman-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html&description=Abdurrahman%20Shugaba%20Darmans%20biography%2c%20net%20worth%2c%20fact%2c%20career%2c%20awards%20and%20life%20story" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./abram-elam-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Abram Elam Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./278317-42-dugg-snaps-after-his-ex-girlfriend-mocks-the-size-of-his-butt-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="42 Dugg Snaps After His Ex-Girlfriend Mocks The Size Of His Butt">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
