Unfortunately, it turns out that a lot of that controversy was well deserved as there are far too many <a href=#>disturbing facts about the show Toddlers & Tiaras</a>. Still, there is no doubt that the show had loads of fans which is why <a href=#>TLC aired a controversial special looking at where the stars of Toddlers & Tiaras are</a> now in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here Comes Honey Boo Boo: 15 Things That Happened Behind The Scenes</a></span></p><p>When it comes to the most famous person to ever appear in an episode of Toddlers & Tiaras, there was no need for them to be included in the aforementioned where are they now special. After all, Alana "Honey Boo Boo" Thompson went on to star in her own spin-off series, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, from 2012 until 2017. Furthermore, since that show ended, the press has continued to cover <a href=#>what Honey Boo Boo’s life has been like after “reality” TV</a>. As a result, the world learned that Honey Boo Boo began dating someone in 2021. Unfortunately, instead of being able to relish the idea that Honey Boo Boo had found someone, the former “reality” stars’ relationship is extremely controversial.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-honey-boo-boo-rsquo-s-relationship-is-so-controversial>Why Honey Boo Boo’s Relationship Is So Controversial</h2><p>When the world was first introduced to Alana “Honey Boo Boo” Thompson during a 2012 episode of Toddlers & Tiaras, she was just a young child. As a result, when it became known that she had a boyfriend, that alone was weird for a lot of people who still saw her as a child. On the other hand, for people who kept up on Honey Boo Boo’s life through the press, social media, and other “reality” shows it was welcome news that she found someone. At least, that was the case until more was revealed about the person Honey Boo Boo was involved with.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here Comes Honey Boo Boo: Recent Pics That Might Confuse Fans</a></span></p><p>When the world learned that Honey Boo Boo had a boyfriend, the much-loved young “reality” star was 16 years old still. While it is typical for teens that age to begin their dating journey, most of them get involved with someone close to their age. As it turned out, however, Honey Boo Boo was dating someone who was years older than her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Celebrity Couples With Disturbing Age Gaps</a></span></p><p>At the time that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a then 16-year-old Honey Boo Boo revealed her boyfriend Dralin Carswell, he was 20 years old</a>. Since she was a minor at that time and Carwell was old enough to vote and he was close to being able to drink legally at the time, the couple’s newly revealed relationship was controversial from the beginning. In fact, when Honey Boo Boo uploaded an image of herself with Carswell on Instagram, the backlash was swift and she deleted the photo before long.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the backlash against Honey Boo Boo’s relationship, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she defended dating Dralin Carswell</a> while speaking to Teen Vogue. According to Honey Boo Boo, Carswell is different than most of the people in her life since he likes her for the right reasons while other people just want to be near a famous person. “To be honest, I do not have many friends. At all. Because I feel like folks are so much like, 'Oh, my God, I'm friends with Honey Boo Boo. I don't trust nobody really, so I don't have friends.”</p><h2 id=why-honey-boo-boo-dating-an-older-man-is-especially-disturbing>Why Honey Boo Boo Dating An Older Man Is Especially Disturbing</h2><p>Sadly for everyone involved, when Honey Boo Boo began dating Dralin Carswell, she wasn’t the first member of her family to be in a controversial relationship. Back when the “reality” show Honey Boo Boo was still on the air and popular, the world learned that Mama June was dating a man who had been convicted of child molestation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once news of Mama June’s relationship with Mark Anthony McDaniel, Sr. went public, many people assumed that they knew the most disturbing truth about the couple. As it turned out, however, that wasn’t the case as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the person that McDaniel, Sr. molested which led to his conviction was Mama June’s daughter Anna</a>. To say it was upsetting that Mama June was dating the man who previously did that to her daughter is a massive understatement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given what the world knew about the situation with Anna, Mama June, and her ex-boyfriend, it makes sense that people were especially upset to learn who Honey Boo Boo was dating. After all, Honey Boo Boo was still a minor and she was dating a legal adult. Given her family’s history, that information comes with a bevy of possibly deeply disturbing implications. Despite how observers feel about the relationship, there is no indication that Honey Boo Boo and Dralin Carwell have broken up as of the time of this writing.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Twitter Reacts To Honey Boo Boo Having A Boyfriend</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqKaVrnqju85mmainXaO8uHnBqLCfqpmau6V5wKCcZp%2BRpXw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhoney-boo-boo-now-boyfriend-age-gap.html&text=Why%20Honey%20Boo%20Boo%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Boyfriend%20Is%20Downright%20Controversial&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhoney-boo-boo-now-boyfriend-age-gap.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhoney-boo-boo-now-boyfriend-age-gap.html&title=Why%20Honey%20Boo%20Boo%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Boyfriend%20Is%20Downright%20Controversial" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhoney-boo-boo-now-boyfriend-age-gap.html&title=Why%20Honey%20Boo%20Boo%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Boyfriend%20Is%20Downright%20Controversial" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhoney-boo-boo-now-boyfriend-age-gap.html&title=Why%20Honey%20Boo%20Boo%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Boyfriend%20Is%20Downright%20Controversial" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhoney-boo-boo-now-boyfriend-age-gap.html&description=Why%20Honey%20Boo%20Boo%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Boyfriend%20Is%20Downright%20Controversial" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1295529-wwe-clash-at-the-castle-poster-features-roman-reigns-more-top-wwe-stars.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="WWE Clash At The Castle Poster Features Roman Reigns, More Top WWE Stars">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tanya-memme-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tanya Memme Net Worth 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
