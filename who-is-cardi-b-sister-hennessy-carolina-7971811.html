Sometimes everyone would be a little weird about it, but then they would just see like, ‘Oh my God, this is love,’ you know?” She went on, “But now I feel free and now I just try to spread the message as much as I possibly can. Love is love no matter what gender.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hennessy previously dated Michelle “Mel” Diaz, whom she often referred to as her “wife” on social media.
