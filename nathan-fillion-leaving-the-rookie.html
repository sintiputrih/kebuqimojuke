But after sharing an emotional post on Instagram, could the former daytime actor be hinting that his time on the police series is nearing its end? <a href=#>Is Nathan Fillion leaving The Rookie</a>? Read on to learn more.</span></p><p><a href=#>The Rookie</a>, ABC’s police procedural drama, follows the story of John Nolan (played by Nathan Fillion), a newly divorced man in his 40s who, after inadvertently helping the police stop a bank robbery, moves from Pennsylvania to Los Angeles, California, to pursue a career as a police officer at the Los Angeles Police Department. The series was created by Alexi Hawley and is based on the true story of William Norcross, a real officer with the Los Angeles Police Department who moved to Los Angeles in 2015 and joined the department in his mid-40s.</p><p>Fillion has played John Nolan since The Rookie Season 1 in 2018. He’s also an executive producer on the series. Fillion’s role as Nolan has proved to be one of the most rewarding in his acting portfolio, which includes playing Joey Buchanan on One Life to Live, Malcolm Reynolds on Fox’s Firefly, and Richard Castle on the ABC dramedy&nbsp;Castle.</p><p>“Castle was fun to play because he got away with everything. I would never hang out with that guy, but playing him was fun. John Nolan is a character I’ve kind of grown into. It’s nice to play someone who is thoughtful,” Fillion told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Toronto Sun</a>&nbsp;in January 2023.</p><p>He continued, “It’s a police show, so there’s a lot of drama and excitement there. But I think there’s something relatable about the redo and the restart,” Fillion responded when asked why The Rookie has connected so well with viewers. “Dropping everything and push into something entirely different. That’s a new reality for a lot of people, especially coming out of the pandemic. We’ve all reprioritized and made changes. People have quit jobs and people can relate to change.”</p><p>The Rookie has gone on to have immense success; the Season 5 premiere earned 8.2 million total viewers, according to an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">ABC press release</a>. The show even spawned a spin-off series, The Rookie: Feds,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>although the show was axed</a> after one season in November 2023.</p><p>Season 6 of&nbsp;The Rookie&nbsp;is set to premiere on February 20, but could this be Fillion’s last run? Keep reading to find out.</p><figure class=embedded-image data-aqa=embed-image></figure><h2><strong>Is Nathan Fillion leaving The Rookie?</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Nathan-Fillion-The-Rookie.jpg alt="Nathan Fillion, The Rookie" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span>Is Nathan Fillion leaving The Rookie? As of February 2024, neither ABC nor Fillion have announced plans for the actor to leave the show. However, with the recent cancellation of The Rookie: Feds, there’s always a chance that this season could be the 52-year-old star’s last (although we really hope not).</span></p><p>Ahead of the Season 6 premiere, the actor penned an emotional post to promote the upcoming season. He also shared a teaser clip for Season 6, which was pushed from fall to spring because of the now-resolved writers’ and actors’ strikes.</p><p class="_ap3a _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade" dir=auto>“It’s been a long time, but we’re finally here.
