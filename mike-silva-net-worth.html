Who was Mike Silva married to?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Mike Silva is a Connecticut-based businessman who is best known as the father of reality TV show sisters Darcey and Stacey Silva.</p><p>As a businessman, he has earned most of his money from his dealings in construction and engineering in China, and he splits his time between the US and China.</p><p>He also owns a production company with his daughters, which contributes to his net worth.</p><p>Below, we explore Mike Silva’s net worth in detail and look at how he has earned his fortune.</p><h2><b>The Origin Story</b></h2><p>Although we don’t know a great deal about Mike’s life before he appeared on the reality TV show 90 Day Fiance, he is divorced from <a href=#>Darcey</a> and Stacey’s mother, Nancy.</p><p>The pair divorced in 1986 when the girls were only twelve years old.</p><p>Although they couldn’t get their marriage to work, they seem to get on well enough and have appeared in several episodes of the show together.</p><p>Aside from his family in Connecticut, it’s not clear whether Mike is in a relationship or has another love interest.</p><p>We know that he owns property in China, and he spends his time between both countries.</p><p>He is active on social media and maintains an Instagram profile – themikesilvaofficial. He doesn’t post very often, but he typically shares snaps of himself with his girls.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Steven McBee Net Worth</a></p><h2><b>Mike Silva – Net Worth</b></h2><p>How much is Mike Silva worth?</p><p>Mike Silva is the father of Darcey and Stacey, who rose to prominence following their appearance on the American reality television series 90 Day Fiance.</p><p>Viewers were taken aback by the lavish lifestyle that the sisters live, and many wondered where they got their money from.</p><p>Well, the answer is through their father.</p><p>Although the sisters are reveling in the popularity of their spin-off show, Darcy & Stacey, there’s no doubt that their father’s wealth has fuelled the lifestyle that they’re both able to live.</p><p>Mike actually appeared on the hit show several times, which made his wealth even more intriguing to Darcy and Stacey’s fans.</p><p>So just how did Mike Silva make his money?</p><p>The most important thing to say about Mike Silva is that he is an incredibly successful businessman and has amassed his fortune from his own dealings.</p><p>He is currently the Chairman at Maison Worley Parsons.</p><p>The international company deals in engineering, procurement, and construction management, and Mike spends most of his time working in China.</p><p>Although the scope of Silva’s projects isn’t clear, we know that he has undertaken a great deal of construction work in China, which is how he has been able to earn so much money throughout his career.</p><p>Darcy revealed that her dad had been working in China for more than 24 years and explained that he spends most of his time away from home.</p><p>Research shows that executives at Maison Worley Parsons earn at least $235,000 per year.</p><p>When you consider the fact that Mike is the chairman of the company, it’s fair to assume that his salary is actually higher than this, showing just how much he has been able to earn from his role within the organization.</p><p>While his business dealings in China have undoubtedly contributed the most to his net worth, he also runs a production company called Eleven Entertainment.</p><p>He launched the company with his daughters, and they have produced two films.</p><p>The first was White T in 2013, and the second was Soul Ties two years later, which starred Flex Alexander and Rosci Diaz.</p><p>Although the films didn’t enjoy mainstream success, there’s no doubt that his work with his production company has contributed to his net worth.</p><p>In fact, it’s through the production company that Mike was able to buy Darcey and Stacey their mansion for $715,000.</p><p>Before buying his daughters their own place, they lived together as a family at Mike’s place in Connecticut.</p><p>Now, they have a six-bedroom and six-bathroom home all to themselves, which has undoubtedly made many of their fans jealous.</p><p>So, thanks to his impressive business dealings in China and the income from his production company, Mike Silva has an estimated net worth of $15 million.</p><p><b>&nbsp;READ THIS NEXT:</b> <a href=#>Who is Sarah Bowmar</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVforassYysoKWukWK7psCMsKarrJhk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmike-silva-net-worth.html&text=Mike%20Silva%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Ex-Wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmike-silva-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmike-silva-net-worth.html&title=Mike%20Silva%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Ex-Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmike-silva-net-worth.html&title=Mike%20Silva%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Ex-Wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmike-silva-net-worth.html&title=Mike%20Silva%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Ex-Wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmike-silva-net-worth.html&description=Mike%20Silva%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Ex-Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./quinn-lundberg-husband-zach-galifianakis-married-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Quinn Lundberg | Husband Zach Galifianakis | Married Life">&larr;
