Not only was the Eras Tour a massive success, but <a href=#>the artist continues to make savvy business investments</a> which inches her closer to the billion dollar net worth mark.</p><p>However, in the following, we're going to prove that Swift is only human after all. She made a couple of mistakes during the Eras Tour. Heck, even <a href=#>veteran artists like Chad Kroeger actually stopped mid-concert</a> to apologize for their mistake. It seems like Taylor Swift did the same thing in multiple instances, though she was especially disappointed after the blunder of an artist's name. We'll reveal how Taylor handled the moment, and why she received praise for it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Taylor Swift's Biggest Sponsorship Deal Worth $100 Million Vanished After The Artist's Team Had Finally Agreed To Terms</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-doubled-the-projections-during-her-eras-tour>Taylor Swift Doubled The Projections During Her Eras Tour</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-10.jpg><p>Taylor Swift had a blast during her Eras Tour, even if it meant fumbling a few songs from time to time. Given all the shows and pressure, it only makes sense that Swift was able to poke fun at herself when mistakes did take place. However, the artist also downplays the success of the tour. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift doubled the projections of the tour</a>. According to Billboard, the show made over half a billion at $591 million.</p><p>Not only were the projections extremely positive, but Swift had the time of her life on stage. She revealed, “I’ve always had fun doing this. I can’t believe I get to do music as a career. That’s crazy. I’ve always had so much fun doing it. I’ve never had this much fun in my life as I have had on TheEras Tour. It is far and away just the most electric experience of my life.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Taylor Swift Awkwardly Had To Present An Award With Amy Poehler Despite Her Questionable Past With The Comedian And Tina Fey</a></span></p><p>Not only did Taylor enjoy the experience, but she also kept consistent with the tour. No matter what took place behind the scenes, Swift has every intention to put on a great show for the fans. “We did this show rain or shine, in sickness and in health, no matter what was going on in our lives. And we did it with a grin on our face because what greeted us on the other side.”</p><p>The hard work clearly paid off, though Swift did have some off script moments along the way.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-handled-her-blunder-with-class-during-the-eras-tour-but-felt-terrible-for-her-gayle-adams-blunder>Taylor Swift Handled Her Blunder With Class During The Eras Tour, But Felt Terrible For Her Gayle Adams Blunder</h2><p>She's only human like the rest of us. The song in question was Death By A Thousand Cuts. It seems like Swift was a little confused over the lyrics of the song. However, she managed to handle the moment with complete class. It takes courage to revamp yourself in front of thousands in attendance, and that's exactly what Swift was able to do, and she got back on the horse after a momentary delay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Credit to Swift for how she handled it all.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Taylor Swift Was Kicked Out The Building By Jimmy Kimmel's Music Booker After She Made A Failed Request</a></span></p><p>However, during her concert in Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift felt awful about a certain mistake</a>. Gayle Adams opened up the show, but Swift accidentally called her Gracie instead. Taylor took time to acknowledge the blunder.</p><p>“Thirteen is a number that has defined all kinds of lucky things for me. But tonight, it is actually also the exact number of brain cells that I have, because earlier, I told you that Gracie Abrams opened the show — that is not correct.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“That is absolutely not correct,” she continued. “Gayle opened the show and she was phenomenal, and I feel so awful.

Certainly more football games. However, she's also thriving elsewhere, and it appears to be on the big-screen. The Eras Tour concert film is off to a ridiculous start, making between $95 million and $97 million during its opening week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is historical for Swift as the film turned into the highest concert opening film of all time. In total, it was estimated that 4.8 million people bought a ticket to watch the concert film.</p><p>More statistics continue to praise the film, as it was the second-best October box office opening, just behind The Joker. And in fairness to the concert film, Swift appeared on fewer screens compared to The Joker. Without a doubt, a great accomplishment for Swift who continues to dominate the entertainment world.</p><p>If this pace continues, she's looking at the $1 billion net worth in a couple of years from now. That projection can take place sooner rather than later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lnZ7Ata3KnqWsZZGnwaq%2F06xkp5mdmnqordilnGaZlJa6tHnDrqmippdisrOt0marqK2iZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-mistakens-artists-name-gayle-adams-during-eras-tour.html&text=Despite%20The%20Success%20Of%20The%20Eras%20Tour%2c%20Taylor%20Swift%20Felt%20Awful%20On-Stage%20After%20She%20Messed%20Up%20An%20Artist&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-mistakens-artists-name-gayle-adams-during-eras-tour.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-mistakens-artists-name-gayle-adams-during-eras-tour.html&title=Despite%20The%20Success%20Of%20The%20Eras%20Tour%2c%20Taylor%20Swift%20Felt%20Awful%20On-Stage%20After%20She%20Messed%20Up%20An%20Artist" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaylor-swift-mistakens-artists-name-gayle-adams-during-eras-tour.html&title=Despite%20The%20Success%20Of%20The%20Eras%20Tour%2c%20Taylor%20Swift%20Felt%20Awful%20On-Stage%20After%20She%20Messed%20Up%20An%20Artist" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-mistakens-artists-name-gayle-adams-during-eras-tour.html&title=Despite%20The%20Success%20Of%20The%20Eras%20Tour%2c%20Taylor%20Swift%20Felt%20Awful%20On-Stage%20After%20She%20Messed%20Up%20An%20Artist" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-mistakens-artists-name-gayle-adams-during-eras-tour.html&description=Despite%20The%20Success%20Of%20The%20Eras%20Tour%2c%20Taylor%20Swift%20Felt%20Awful%20On-Stage%20After%20She%20Messed%20Up%20An%20Artist" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./emma-heming-willis-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emma Heming Willis Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./last-tango-in-paris-rape-scene-wasnt-consensual-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bernardo Bertolucci Admits Last Tango in Paris Butter-Rape Scene Was Nonconsensual">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
