It's safe to say, the former military man was a fan favorite, and his sudden departure from the show was baffling, to say the least.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Willis spent ten years as an Air Force Pararescueman</a>, and four years as an Army Ranger. After he retired from the military, Willis began using his expert weaponry knowledge as a commentator on various TV shows and even an actor in hit movies. Then, in 2015, he began hosting Forged in Fire. Season 8 premiered with Ultimate Survival Alaska alum Grady Powell as the new host, and fans are wondering what happened to Willis.</p><p><strong>Updated on January 20, 2023: </strong>Wil Willis has stayed out of Hollywood since Forged in Fire: Beat the Judges in 2020. He is now focusing on life as a husband and father, spending as much time with his family as he can. Willis is, however, still taking time for his passions; in May 2022, he shared on Instagram a knife he was making with a fellow artist. Wil does not post on social media much, except to share information that is close to his heart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-wil-willis><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Who Is Wil Willis?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/wil-willis-closeup.jpg><p>The History Channel star was born in Portugal in 1975, remaining there only through his elementary school years.

Even over the pandemic and lockdown, Willis was basking in fatherhood and enjoying the time with his family — especially after the turbulent year that was 2020.</p><p>Additionally, in a December 2020 episode of the B3f podcast, Willis opened up about the demanding nature of the Forged in Fire filming process. He shared that it takes "three to five days to film an episode," and admitted the process can be "boring." Although he expressed his appreciation for the show and its crew, his comments suggested he was ready for a new adventure.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>These 12 Celebrities Have Some Of Hollywood's Most Dramatic Parents</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Willis did not return to the show, the History Channel issued a statement assuring fans that Grady Powell will be ushering in a new era of Forged in Fire.

While we appreciate Wil Willis and everything he brought to the series, we are excited to start this new chapter and welcome Grady Powell into the 'forge' as our new host."</p><p>Despite the statement, the response from fans proved they were still unsatisfied, with some asking to bring the old host back.</p><h2 id=who-is-grady-powell><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Who Is Grady Powell?</span></h2><p>Grady Powell is a former U.S. Army Green Beret and Senior Detachment Weapons Sergeant.
