And for two years he shows up for hearings.</p><p>"He's making his court appearances," Manzella said.</p><p>“Until one day, he does not.”</p><p>This was in January 2015.</p><p>Emptying his safety deposit box, Chadwick fled to Mexico again, but he could not be tracked this time.</p><h2>MOST WANTED LIST</h2><p>Six years after the murder of QC Chadwick, a podcast was launched by a new sergeant at the Newport Beach Police Department, Court Depweg.</p><p>After the first episode of "Countdown to Capture" in September 2018, the police began receiving tips about Chadwick's disappearance; they even offered a $100,000 reward for his capture.</p><p>Peter Chadwick was placed on the US Marshall 15 Most Wanted list.</p><p>At the end of the last podcast episode, Depweg sends a final message to Peter, who had been on the run for more than three years.</p><p>“Peter, end this now,” Depweg said.</p><p>“We are coming for you. This begins your countdown to capture.”</p><p>After receiving tips and using their solid investigative background, the US Marshalls and the Mexican Federales learned that Peter ran to Mexico.</p><p>Police were able to track down his location after Peter made a call from Cholula, Mexico - 2,000 miles from Newport Beach, California.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>When he was arrested in August 2019, Peter had already settled in the country for nearly five years.</p><p>He is currently serving 15 years to life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdmaYZ5hZNqZqatopmys3nIp62eq6SetKLAyKilZp6RoratxYyppp2bkajBbrzErZyrZaGYeqS0wJ2uopubZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmurder-investigation-family-podcast-peter-qc-chadwick.html&text=Inside%20Peter%20Chadwick%27s%20brutal%20murder%20of%20college%20sweetheart%20wife%20Q.C.%20and%20the%20international%20manhunt%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmurder-investigation-family-podcast-peter-qc-chadwick.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmurder-investigation-family-podcast-peter-qc-chadwick.html&title=Inside%20Peter%20Chadwick%27s%20brutal%20murder%20of%20college%20sweetheart%20wife%20Q.C.%20and%20the%20international%20manhunt%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmurder-investigation-family-podcast-peter-qc-chadwick.html&title=Inside%20Peter%20Chadwick%27s%20brutal%20murder%20of%20college%20sweetheart%20wife%20Q.C.%20and%20the%20international%20manhunt%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmurder-investigation-family-podcast-peter-qc-chadwick.html&title=Inside%20Peter%20Chadwick%27s%20brutal%20murder%20of%20college%20sweetheart%20wife%20Q.C.%20and%20the%20international%20manhunt%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmurder-investigation-family-podcast-peter-qc-chadwick.html&description=Inside%20Peter%20Chadwick%27s%20brutal%20murder%20of%20college%20sweetheart%20wife%20Q.C.%20and%20the%20international%20manhunt%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jarrett-thomas-bio-age-net-worth-height-southern-charm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Jarrett Thomas!
