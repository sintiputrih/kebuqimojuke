The show, which ran from 1984 until 1992, serves as a comedy classic, launching the careers of many stars. Unfortunately, many fans feel that the series's legacy has been tarnished by its eponymous star. Long before Bill Cosby was known as a <a href=# rel>reviled sexual predator</a>, the comedian upheld a squeaky-clean image that assisted in normalizing wealth, happiness, and prosperity in black American television. Despite the asterisk placed on Cosby's legacy, the pioneering series' other major stars have all gone on to do great things.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-phylicia-rashad>Phylicia Rashad</h2></span><p>NEWARK, NJ - AUGUST 26: Actress Phylicia Rashad speaks on stage during the 2018 Black Girls Rock! at New Jersey Performing Arts Center on August 26, 2018 in Newark, New Jersey.

As a working lawyer and mother of five, Clair acts as a quintessential 1980s icon, grounding the series amid her husband Cliff's goofy antics. Since the show concluded in 1992, Rashad has continued her illustrious film and television career. Her most notable roles include Diana DuBois in the Fox drama Empire, as well as Adonis Creed's mother Mary Anne in <a href=# rel>the Creed trilogy</a>. Most recently, Rashad appeared in the television series Diarra From Detroit, which premiered in June 2023.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sabrina-le-beauf>Sabrina Le Beauf</h2></span><p>Actor Sabrina LeBeauf attends the 9th Annual TV Land Awards at the Javits Center on April 10, 2011 in New York City.

Though the character didn't appear until the show's 10th episode, she stayed on for over 175 appearances, making her an instantly recognizable figure to '80s television fans. Since The Cosby Show ended, Le Beauf has gone on to appear in such projects as Star Trek: The Next Generation, The Sinbad Show, and the Bill Cosby-created animated series Fatherhood. Sabrina Le Beauf stepped away from on-camera work in the 2010s to focus on her stage career.
