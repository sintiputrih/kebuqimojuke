The iciest drama queen, just as the hopeless romantic, each has their own way of approaching connections with other people.</p><p>When we are addressing astrological compatibility, we often reference two people’s Sun signs: Ascendants (Rising signs) and Moon signs. These can help us to understand how they are likely to relate, as well as their strengths and weaknesses as a couple. Yet, there’s another way that can clue you into how you may link with someone else by referencing each of your Venus signs. In our birth charts, we each have all of the planets imprinted within them, exactly where they were the moment we took our first breaths.</p><p>Venus is the planet of love, relationships and intimacy. However, she also colors your personality by giving insight into what you value, your aesthetics, style, fashion and tastes. Be sure to look up your Venus sign and find out what it means for you!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>VENUS IN ARIES</strong></h2><p>Venus in Aries makes someone crave passion and activity in their love life. That often means they are unafraid to jump headfirst into romance and very fall in love very quickly. They may be a leader in romantic situations and are likely impulsive, aggressive and bold. These individuals aren’t afraid to go for who or what they want and always put their own desires first. They will require a partner who encourages excitement at their side. In a sense, they will always be children at heart.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"><span class=credit>Shutterstock</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>VENUS IN TAURUS</strong></h2><p>Venus in Taurus is one of the most physical and sensual places for her to be. People with this placement are romantics to their core. They desire security, stability and comfort in relationships and often take a very slow pace in getting to know someone. Courtship can be especially important in order to take time opening up to one another. Affection, as well as giving and receiving gifts, often becomes extremely crucial to the development and maintenance of the rapport between them and others. Spoiling others and being lavishly spoiled are a part of their love language. That is one of the luckiest placements for someone to have Venus, as she is the natural ruler of Taurus, and thus can share her greatest blessings most easily.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>VENUS IN GEMINI</strong></h2><p>Venus in Gemini causes a person to place communication as a top priority in relationships. That desire for mental and intellectual connection brings a desire to articulate and discuss ideas, feelings and plans. Writing, speaking and communication come especially easy to them — often leading them to be very charming and social. People who harbor this placement prefer variety and spontaneity in their romantic lives. They tend to be very curious about others and the world, and may even be prone to pursuing many different romantic options at a time. The ideal partner for them is someone who nourishes their mind and aids them in being more adventurous.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>VENUS IN CANCER</strong></h2><p>Venus in Cancer is all about security and commitment in their connections. They value emotional union on deeper levels — but don’t take risks easily and often take a while to open up. People with this placement don’t particularly enjoy casual dating — unless it’s with one person and they are building toward something more serious. Being vulnerable is something that takes time, yet one of their greatest assets is being able to nurture others and embrace their sentimental side. Loyalty is a top priority for them, and they enjoy intimacy, cuddling and domesticity.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Venus in Cancer is about security and commitment in connections, so cuddle up! <span class=credit>Shutterstock</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>VENUS IN LEO</strong></h2><p>Venus in Leo brings a fiery spirit that wants to experience romance like a grand, theatrical event! People with this placement tend to be bold and vibrant, hungry for love and passion. While that may encourage someone to dive headfirst into dating, that often leads someone to be very interested in the courtship period of relationships. With Venus in this Fire sign, one requires over-the-top gestures, as well a great deal of admiration from potential partners. Affection, worship and loyalty are often more important than sex — but that doesn’t mean they don’t have a lusty side. People with this placement prefer to be shown off by their partners, as well as put their PDA on display!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>VENUS IN VIRGO</strong></h2><p>Venus in Virgo gives someone a practical, stable and analytical approach to dating and relationships. While that can lead someone to be especially nurturing, compassionate and affectionate, it often takes them a long while to truly open up, trust and be vulnerable. Sometimes that will lead them to attract partners they want to fix or “save.” Being in a union that logically makes sense is also important for these individuals — as well as finding someone who has good hygiene, takes direction and has a solid character.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>VENUS IN LIBRA</strong></h2><p>Venus in Libra makes someone a true romantic to their core! They thrive in relationships and are often looking for their mirror image or perfect partner. People with this placement crave balance, peace and being surrounded by beauty. They will strive to keep the peace and establish harmony wherever they go. However, in order to not cause friction, they can at times nonchalantly go with the flow and opt for codependency rather than standing up for themselves. They have an easy time connecting with many people, as they tend to be extremely flirtatious, charming and social. This is a lucky placement for Venus, as she rules this zodiac sign and can spread her blessings very easily.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>VENUS IN SCORPIO</strong></h2><p>Venus in Scorpio causes someone to demand intensity, passion and total intimacy in their love lives and relationships. Their desire for union is not just physical, but in mind and spirit as well. That can lead them to become especially possessive of others, craving “all or nothing.” However, this placement can also make individuals extremely magnetic, mysterious, sexy and seductive. While that often causes people to be secretive regarding their private lives, they search for someone who is more practical, physical and giving so that they are the ones who swim in the tempest of their hearts. Sometimes people with this placement crave fatal attraction connections — relationships that are destructive, fiery and transformative. However, over time, they learn to temper these feelings and usually find partners who are more grounded to stabilize them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>VENUS IN SAGITTARIUS</strong></h2><p>Venus in Sagittarius causes someone to hunger for excitement, adventure and spontaneity in their relationships above all. They demand new experiences and can at times prefer casual unions to settling down. People with this placement tend to be quite open-minded and optimistic regarding love, embracing their eternal free spirit. Being tied down to a controlling or overly possessive partner will cause these individuals to run the other way! Travel, exploring new cultures and destinations and embracing the freedom to roam will feed the fire within their hearts. Finding someone who also enjoys a sojourner lifestyle will allow this person to feel safe to open themselves up.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Travel and new destinations are key for Venus in Sagittarius. <span class=credit>Shutterstock</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>VENUS IN CAPRICORN</strong></h2><p>Venus in Capricorn causes someone to focus on commitment, longevity and the material value of relationships. They value consistency above all else, as well as finding someone who wants to build the lifestyle they desire at their side. Partners who can provide financially or help elevate them toward their goals and ambitions are also especially intriguing to these individuals. When it comes to intimacy, these people are very sensual and earthy, looking to play the long game with someone who wants to build a home or family. Success, status and power may also be a “turn-on” for these people, too.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>VENUS IN AQUARIUS</strong></h2><p>Venus in Aquarius gives someone the desire to explore the highest level of intellectual connection with others. While one may initially appear detached or aloof because of this, it is simply because they demand a truly authentic mental connection with another to open up. These individuals are not highly intimate or affectionate, but can certainly be very open-minded when it comes to sex, courtship, experimentation, and dating. Non-traditional relationships may intrigue these people, as well as pursuing new experiences and travel. Communication will always be a top priority for these people, too.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>VENUS IN PISCES</strong></h2><p>Venus in Pisces blesses someone with a deeply sensitive, creative and romantic heart. These people often see through rose-colored glasses and dive headfirst into a fantasy as soon as their heart ignites! They tend to be especially emotional, easily getting carried away by their feelings, hopes and dreams. They crave a partner who stirs their powerful emotions but who also encourages them to be practical and grounded as well. Because of their ever-changing thoughts, though, they can just as easily dive into a union as well as swim away if they feel trapped or controlled. This placement for Venus is one of the luckiest because she is known to be “exalted” in this zodiac sign.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyle Thomas</a> is a globally recognized pop culture astrologer who has been featured in “Access Hollywood,” E!
