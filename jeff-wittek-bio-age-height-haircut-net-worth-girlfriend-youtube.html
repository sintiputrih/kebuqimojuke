Some can draw, some can create and do many mind-boggling things, sometimes with nothing at all. Well, this particular individual can change the appearance of a man only with a haircut. He is none other than<strong> Jeffrey Wittek,</strong> also known as <strong>Jeff</strong>.</p><p>Don’t be fooled; he is neither a singer nor an actor. With his fantastic barber skills and fresh appearance, Jeff has won the hearts of many people. Not only us, but celebrities like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">DJ Pauly D</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Big Sean</a> have also tested his skills. So, let’s get to know him more right now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/jeff-0002.jpg><p>Here are some interesting facts about Jeff.</p><h2>Jeff Wittek: Quick Facts</h2><table class=facts><tbody><tr><th>Full Name:</th><td>Jeffrey Wittek</td></tr><tr><th>Age:</th><td>30 years</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Date:</th><td>December 15, 1989</td></tr><tr><th>Horoscope:</th><td>Sagitarrius</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Place:</th><td>Staten Island, New York, USA</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity:</th><td>White</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality:</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Height:</th><td>6 feet 1 inch(185 cm)</td></tr><tr><th>Weight:</th><td>82 kg(180 lbs)</td></tr><tr><th>Body Measurements:</th><td>42-32-37</td></tr><tr><th>Eye color:</th><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><th>Hair color:</th><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><th>Martial Status:</th><td>Unmarried</td></tr><tr><th>Girlfriend:</th><td>Cierra Ramirez</td></tr><tr><th>Profession:</th><td>Hairstylist, YouTuber</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth:</th><td>$500,000</td></tr><tr><th>Social Media:</th><td><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a></td></tr><tr><th>Religion:</th><td>Christianity</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>The talented hairstylist, Jeff, named <strong>Jeffery Wittek,</strong> was born on December 15, 1989, in Staten Island, New York, the United States of America. He is American by nationality and belongs to white ethnicity. Also, his religion is Christian.</p><p>Similarly, he has not mentioned much about his parents and family. None of their names and whereabouts are known as we speak. The same is the case with his academics. We will update you on this matter soon enough.</p><h2>Age and Height: How Old Is Jeff Wittek?</h2><p>Talking about age, the talented Jeff is currently 30 years old. He turned 30 this year on the 15th of December, which is few weeks ahead of Christmas.&nbsp;Also, his birth sign is Sagitarrius, and people born under this sign are said to be far-sighted and visionary.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miyuki Sawashiro Bio- Career, Seiyuu, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>Likewise, not only is Jeff talented, but he is equally good looking as well. We can see why people mistook Jeff for being a model or at least an Instagram model. At the height of 6 feet 1 inch(185 cm), he weighs about 82 kg(180 lbs). Also, Wittek has a healthy physique with a measurement of 42-32-37 inches.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/jeff-001.jpg><p>Not to mention, Jeff makes a great effort to be in shape, regardless of what people say. Moreover, with his dark brown eyes and short dark brown hair, Jeff looks even more dashing and charismatic.</p><h2>Jeff Wittek: Haircut and Merch</h2><p>Jeff is famous in the entertainment world as the celebrity hairstylist known for his skills. So, how did he gain such fandom? It all started when he first created a Tumblr blog under the name ‘BehindTheCuts.’&nbsp;</p><p>After that, Wittek created a Vine account and started posting entertaining videos under the alias <strong>‘American Jeff.’ </strong>Furthermore, he got a chance to collaborate with many Vine artists, including <strong>Christian DelGrosso, Rudy Mancuso</strong>, and <strong>Anwar Jibawi.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>From Tumblr, Jeff then moved to YouTube and created a new account in 2011, where he started uploading acting sessions, hairstyle videos, and vlogs. From then to now, his YouTube followers have increased at a significant rate. At the moment, Wittek has over 2.27&nbsp;million subscribers, with more than 153 million views.</p><p>Some of his popular videos on his channel include ‘Homeless Man Makeover,” Giving David Dobrik a new haircut,’ Jonah Hill haircut ft. David Dobrik’ and many others. Moreover, each of those videos has amassed more than 3 million views already.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Navid Negahban Bio- Movies, TV Shows, Age, Wife, Net Worth, IG >></a></h4><p>As of April 30, his ‘Giving David Dobrick a New Haircut’ is the most-watched video followed by ‘Homeless Man Makeover’ on his channel. Besides being a hairstylist, Jeff is also an actor by profession. Until now, the inspiring actor has appeared in movies such as Declined Credit Card(2016), Crazy Drug Lord(2016), and Petting Scorpions(2017) alongside his girlfriend.</p><h2>Jeff Wittek: Net Worth and Income</h2><p>As of 2020, the talented Jeff with skilled hands has an estimated net worth of <strong>$500,000.</strong> Most of his income comes from his successful career as a hairstylist. To add up, he also runs a YouTube channel from where he earns a decent amount of money.</p><p>Moreover, as online sources claim, an American celebrity hairstylist makes about <strong>$100,000</strong> per year. And considering Jeff’s popularity, it seems he makes around <strong>$500-$10,000</strong> from his Instagram post alone.</p><h2>Personal Life: Girlfriend and Dating</h2><p>Jeff is a handsome and charming man who is in his prime year. Just like other celebrities, he also has a loyal fanbase who watches his every move. And quite frankly, Jeff too was not much of a secret keeper when it came to his relationship. In fact, the social media star was very open about it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/jeff-0003.jpg><p>Likewise, Wittek was in a romantic relationship with an American actress, <strong>Cierra Ramirez</strong>. The two lovebirds quickly took a liking to each other and started dating. Though many fans were heartbroken about the news, at the same time, they also supported his relationship.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay McGraw Bio- Wife, Kids, Age, Height, Net Worth, Books, IG >></a></h4><p>Moreover, the young man is also open when it comes to his relationship. As a matter of fact, both of them are seen attending many events and venues together. It seems the duo has been together since January 31, 2015, after one faithful encounter at the club.</p><p>However, social celebrity status is not an easy feat to handle. It might look glamorous and fun but needs just as much dedication as other fields of work.</p><p>But the very same thing Jeff was passionate about came in between his relationship with Cierra. Jeff posted a video titled ‘a personal conversation with my new friend’ on Toddy Smith’s YouTube channel where he expressed;</p><h3>“…but now when you are like experiencing these things that used to be great and like make great memories, you’re getting pulled like, ‘Okay, we gotta shoot this here and do this thing with the logo and the branding and all right guys smile, be happy, like laughs, and like hold hands, now kiss.”</h3><p>He then continued,</p><h3>“People are directing you to kiss and you guys are both feeling it like,’ Okay, are we in a real relationship, or are we doing something that’s convenient for both of us…”</h3><p>Though Cierra was supportive about it and understood the work, their relationship just could not be saved anymore. Hence, both of them decided to quit it like an understanding of adults.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>–&nbsp; 3 million Followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">YouTube</a>–&nbsp; 2.27&nbsp;million Followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Twitter</a>–&nbsp; 295.7k Followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57yZ6dn2WnnsG1scpmmaKnXZa0pnnHnqCgoKRitaK10ZysrWWemsFuw86rq6Fll56%2FrbLRopynnF2uvLbA1JucaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjeff-wittek-bio-age-height-haircut-net-worth-girlfriend-youtube.html&text=Jeff%20Wittek%3a%20Haircut%2c%20Career%2c%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20Girlfriend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeff-wittek-bio-age-height-haircut-net-worth-girlfriend-youtube.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeff-wittek-bio-age-height-haircut-net-worth-girlfriend-youtube.html&title=Jeff%20Wittek%3a%20Haircut%2c%20Career%2c%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjeff-wittek-bio-age-height-haircut-net-worth-girlfriend-youtube.html&title=Jeff%20Wittek%3a%20Haircut%2c%20Career%2c%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjeff-wittek-bio-age-height-haircut-net-worth-girlfriend-youtube.html&title=Jeff%20Wittek%3a%20Haircut%2c%20Career%2c%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeff-wittek-bio-age-height-haircut-net-worth-girlfriend-youtube.html&description=Jeff%20Wittek%3a%20Haircut%2c%20Career%2c%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./stefanie-vettel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sebastian Vettels Father Norbert Vettel Loves Attending His Races ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hunter-biden-biography-age-wife-net-worth-wiki-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hunter Biden Biography, Age, Wife, Net Worth, Wiki, Children">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
